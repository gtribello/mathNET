TITLE: The partition function for molecular gasses

DESCRIPTION:

It is common to assume that there are no intermolecular interactions between molecules when calculating the partition 
function for a molecular gas.  Furthermore, it is also common to assume that the Hamiltonian for the molecules can be 
written as a sum of electronic, $H_e$, translational, $H_t$, rotational, $H_r$ and vibrational, $H_v$, parts as shown below:
$$
H = H_e + H_t + H_r + H_v
$$ 
as if the Hamiltonian can be written in this way the partition function can be written as a product of electronic, 
translational, rotational and vibrational parts:
$$
Z = Z_e \times Z_t \times Z_r \times Z_v
$$

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to explain why the partition function can be written as a product of vibrational, electronic, translational and vibrational parts.
- You should be able to determine how many degrees of freedom a molecule contaning $N$ atoms possesses and how many of these degrees of freedom are translations, how many are rotational and how many are vibrational.
- You should be able to write an expression for the translational partition function based on your knowledge of the ideal gas model.- You should be able to derive an expression for the partition function of a harmonic vibrational degree of freedom.
- You should be able to derive expressions for the partition function of a rigid rotor, a symmetric top an assymetric top and a linear molecule.
- You should be able to explain what the equipartition principle tells us about the average energy of each degree of freedom of the molecule.

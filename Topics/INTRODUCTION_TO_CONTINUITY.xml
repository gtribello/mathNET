  <DESCRIPTION>


Roughly speaking a function, $f(x)$, is said to be continuous if small changes in the input result

in small changes in the output.  A function is discontinous if there are large jumps in the value of the

function at specific points.  There are many subtleties here but as a first intuitive definition we can 

write that a function is continuous at $x$ if:

$$

\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0 ) f(x+\epsilon) = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0 ) f(x-\epsilon)

$$

At any point, $x$, where the above does not hold the function will be discontinuous.

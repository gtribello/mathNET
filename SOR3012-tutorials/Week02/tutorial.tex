\begin{document}

\section{Aim}

The aim of the tutorial this week is to look at the way that we study and to compare it with the ways that other students in the class study.

\section{Bring}

Please bring multiple copies of the report you wrote on the work that you did during week 1.  This should have been handed in through the assignment tool on Queen's online before the class.  In 
addition, bring your notes on the module as well as paper, pens and suitable items of stationery.

\section{Approach}

You will work in groups of four.  Each of you should read the report that was written by each your colleagues. You should then write a short critical piece on what they have written.  Here are some 
questions you might consider as you write your piece:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Did you do more or less work than your colleague this week?
 \item How does what you did differ from what they did?
 \item Were there any things that you colleague found difficult that you found easy?  By the same token is there anything they found easy that you found difficult?
 \item What do you think they should do differently next week?
 \item Is there anything on which you might work on together next week?
 \item Having read what they did last week is there anything that you will do differently?
\end{enumerate}

You do not need to write your piece in silence and you can (and should) discuss things with your colleagues before you write them down.  I do, however, have an expectation that you will be able to 
write something about each of the three colleagues in your group during the session and I will be going around to check what you are writing.

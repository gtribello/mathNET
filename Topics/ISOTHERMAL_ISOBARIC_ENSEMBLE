TITLE: The isothermal isobaric ensemble

DESCRIPTION:

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to write an expression for the isothermal isobaric partition function.
- You should be able to write an expression for the probability of being in a particular micostate if the system has constant number of atoms, constant pressure and constant temperature.
- You should be able to explain the relation between the isothermal isobaric partition function and the Gibbs free energy.
- You should be able to explain how ensemble averages are calculated in the isothermal isobaric ensemble
- You should be able to explain how we can calculate the ensemble average of the volume by taking a derivative of the isothermal-isobaric partition function.
- You should be able to explain how the compressibility can be calculated from fluctutations.

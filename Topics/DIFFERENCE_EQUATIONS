TITLE: Difference equations

DESCRIPTION:

The linear equation for the unknown vector $\mathbf{x}$, involving the
known vector $\mathbf{b}$ 
and the matrix, $\mathbf{A}$, with rank less than the dimension of $\mathbf{b}$;
$$
\mathbf{Ax}=\mathbf{b}  \quad ,
$$
has a general solution that  can be written in terms of the homogeneous solution
(null-space/kernel  vector) and the particular solution:
$$
\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x}_{\rm homo}+\mathbf{x}_{\rm part}
$$
where:
$$
\mathbf{Ax}_{\rm homo}=0 \qquad, \qquad \mathbf{Ax}_{\rm part} =\mathbf{b} \quad
.
$$

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to explain the difference between a homogeneous difference equations and an inhomogeneous difference equations.
- You should be able to solve homogeneous difference equations and inhomogeneous difference equations.

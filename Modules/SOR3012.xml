  <TITLE> Stochastic Processes and Risk </TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>
     The theory of stochastic process is used to model the future behavior of systems in fields ranging from finance to weather forecasing. 
     In stochastic models the future behavior of the system is modelled using random variables and probability.  One can thus obtain information
     on the likelihood that the future will transpire in a particular way.
     
     In this module we focus primarily on probabilistic models that have the Markov property.  In these models the probability of the future transpiring in a 
     particular way depends only on the present state of the system and not on what happened in the past. These models find application in physics, quantitative
     finance and machine learning.  A particularly important application of Markov processes is the method of Monte Carlo integration.  We will thus finish by 
     studying this technique and its application to problems in Bayesian inference.

           We encode our understanding of what might happen in those experiments in the future in a function known as the cumulative probability distribution function.  
           The value of this function, $F_X(x)$, at small x tells you the probability that the random variable will take a value less than or equal to x.

           $x_i$ multiplied by the probabiltiy mass function $f_X(x_i)$.  In other words, $\mathbb{E}[X] = \sum_{i=0}^\infty x_if_X(x_i)$

           The variance of a random variable, $X$, can be calculated by taking the expectation of $[X-\mathbb{E}(X)]^2$ or by computing the expectation

        <CALL> Why is the expectation an important quantity? </CALL>
        <RESPONSE>
           The expectation is important because the sum of $n$ independent and identically distributed random variables divided by $n$ converges towards this 
           particular value because of a result known as the law of large numbers.  The law of large number states:
           $$
           \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} P\left( \left| \frac{S_n}{n} - \mathbb{E}(X) \right| &gt; \epsilon \right) = 0
           $$
           where $n$ is the number of independent random variables with expectation $\mathbf{E}(X)$ that have been added together to give $S_n$ and where $\epsilon$ 
           is a small number.

           The central limit theorem states that the cumulative probability distribution function for a sum of independent and identically distributed random variables of 
           most types can be approximated using the cumulative probability distribution function of a normal distribution.  More precisely it states:
           $$
            \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} P\left( \frac{S_n/n - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \le z \right) = \Phi(z)
           $$
           where $n$ is the number of independent random variables with expectation $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ that have been added together to give $S_n$ and where 
           $\Phi(z)$ is the cumulative probability distribution function for the standard normal distribution with expectation 0 and variance 1.

        <RESPONSE>
           To understand if the result from one experiment, (capital) $X$, affects the outcome of a second, different experiment, (capital) $Y$ we use the 
           conditional probability.  The conditional probability that $X=3$ given $Y=2$ is equal to the probability that $X=3$ AND $Y=2$ divided by the 
           probability that $Y=2$.  In other words:
           $$
             P(X=3|Y=2) = \frac{ P(X=3 \wedge Y=2) }{ P(Y=2) }

        <RESPONSE>
             If $X=2$ whenever $Y=4$ then the events $X=2$ and $Y=4$ are concurrent.  These two events always happen at the same time and the conditional 
             probablity $P(X=2|Y=4)$ is equal to one.

        <RESPONSE>
           If $X$ is never equal to 2 whenever $Y=4$ then the events $X=2$ and $Y=4$ are mutually exclusive.  $Y$'s equalling 4 somehow prevents $X$ from equalling two 
           and the conditional probability $P(X=2|Y=4)$ is equal to zero.

        </CALL>
        <RESPONSE>
          If the value the random variable $X$ takes has no effect on the value on the value the random variable $Y$ the two random variables are said to 
          be indepdent.  For all possible values of $x$ and $y$ the conditional probability $P(X=x|Y=y)=P(X=x)$ and the conditional probability $P(Y=y|X=x)=P(Y=y)$.

        <CALL> Can two events be both independent and mutually exclusive? </CALL>
        <RESPONSE>
          Two events $X=3$ and $Y=2$ cannot be independent and mutually exclusive as indepdences implies that the conditional probability $P(X=3|Y=2)=P(X=3)$, while
          mutual exclusivity implies that the conditional probability $P(X=3|Y=2)=0$.  We can conclude from these two equations that $P(X=3)=0$ and hence that the 
          event $X=3$ is impossible.

        <RESPONSE>
          The simplest kind of stochastic process is a Markov chain.  A time series of random variables is said to have to have the Markov property if 
          the values the random variable take at future times depends only on the current value the random variable.  In other words, the values the
          random takes in the future does not depend on the values random variables took during the past.  This is a rather colloquial definition a 
          more formal definition for a Markov chain is a time series of random variables whose probability distribution functions have the following 
          property:
          $$
           P(X_{t+1}=x_{t+1} | X_0=x_0 \wedge X_1=x_1 \wedge \dots \wedge X_{t}=x_t) = P( X_{t+1}=x_{t+1} | X_{t}=x_t)

           A Markov chain has a limiting stationary distribution when all the states in the chain are recurrent.  A markov chain with a limiting stationary 
           distribution is said to be ergodic.  This stationary distribution can be found by finding the top left eigenvector of the transition probability matrix.  
           Furthermore, a Markov chain which has only recurrent states satisfies the ergodic theorem which tells us 1 over the expected return time to a state is 
           equal to the fraction of time the system stays in that state.

  <PORTFOLIO>
     <DESCRIPTION>
        One of the components of the assessment for this module is a portfolio of work that you must produce over the course of the semester.  This portfolio counts for 45 
        percent of your final module mark.  It should contain:

        \begin{itemize}
        \item[(A)] 10 reports describing what you have worked on each week.  These reports are due by 16:00 on Tuesday in weeks 2 through 12 of the semester.  
            See the self study section of the markscheme below. 
        
        \item[(B)] Three attempts at the projects detailed in either the extend or final project sections of the module pages.  You should attempt as many of these projects 
            as you can over the course of the semester and hand in the three that you felt were your best attempts by 16:00 on the Tuesday of week 13.  You should not hand in 
            the project on random variables that you produced in week 4 for this assessment to be reassessed as this project is already assessed as part of a different module 
            component.  On my website you will notice that each project has been ascribed a level of difficulty that ranges from 1 to 4.  As explained below the level acts as 
            a guide on the maximum mark that you can get by handing in that particular project.  If you choose to submit level 1 projects for instance you can score a maximum 
            of 24/40.  To be clear, however, this does not mean you should not attempt the easier projects.  You should in fact ALWAYS start with an attempt on the level 1 
            projects before moving on to the harder projects as poor attempts on the harder projects will most likely fail.  In short, I would rather see good attempts at the 
            easier projects than bad attempts at the harder projects.     
        \end{itemize}

        Notice that tutorials and the computer classes are compulsory and that you will be awarded a mark of zero for the portfolio project if you do not attend 70 percent 
        of the tutorials and computer classes.  In addition, notice that your portfolio will be awarded a mark of zero if it does not contain all of the components detailed 
        above (10 weekly reports and 3 projects).
     </DESCRIPTION>
     <COMPONENT>
        <TITLE> Self study </TITLE>
        <DESCRIPTION>
            The first component of the assessment is based on how you have studied for the module.  You must hand in a report that is at least half a page in length every week in which you detail what, when and how you 
            intended to study during the week and what you actually achieved during the week.  You may choose to detail what resources you have used and what parts of the material you found 
            easy and what you found difficult.  You might also want to talk about any conversatiosn you had the lecturer/teaching assistants.  You should also explain what resources you studied 
            from and what resources were particularly useful.  Lastly, you should demonstrate that you have thought about what you did this week and how you might study more effectively in the 
            future.

        <TITLE> Mark capping for projects </TITLE>
        <DESCRIPTION>
            As discussed above each project has an associated level of difficulty and the marks that you will receive will be capped based on the level of difficulty of the 
            projects you attempt.  To be clear, the expectation is that you attempt A LOT of the projects and that you decide what you can and cannot do yourself.  In other
            words, attempt the projects at levels 1, 2 and 3 before attempting the projects at level 4.  Please do not feel pressured to attempt projects that you do not 
            understand in order to get a higher mark.  If you do so you will most likely get a very poor mark as I would rather see the easier projects done to a high standard
            than the harder projects completed to a very low standard.  Also note that I would like to see you attempt projects from all the chapters of the module.  Please do 
            not submit level 1, level 2 and level 3 projects that are all on the central limit theorem.  If you do this your portfolio will be given a very low mark.

        <TITLE> Final mark </TITLE>
        <DESCRIPTION>
           When marking a project I will award the first 16 marks if your project does not contain grevious errors.  To be clear the expectation for project work is that all 
           the mathematics in your report should be correct.  Your report will then be given a mark out of 8 using the scale below.  This mark will then be multiplied by a 1 
           if the project is level 1, 1.5 if the project is level 2, 2 if the project is level 3 and 3 if the project is level 4.  If the project is level 0 you will get a maximum
           of 16 marks.

           Your final mark portfolio mark is the arithmetic mean of the marks that you obtain for the three projects.  Remember, however, that you you must submit three projects 
           from three different chapters of the module and that penalties will be applied if you submit more than one project on the same chapter.  For example if you submit a 
           level one and level four project on the same chapter the level four project will be marked as if it is a level 1 project.

        <TITLE> Investigating other random variables </TITLE>
        <DESCRIPTION>
           Performing the exercises in the apply and extend parts of this project will teach you how to generate uniform, bernoulli, binomial, poisson, geometric, exponential and normal random variables.
           You will learn how to derive expressions for the expectations and variances of these different types of random variables from the random variables parameters.  Furthermore, you 
           will learn about the law of large numbers and how we can estimate expectations and probability distribution functions by repeatedly generating random variables from a particular 
           distribution.  Some suggestions as to how to take your research in these ideas a little further are given below.  You may also want to discuss what you plan to research further with your lecturer.

              <LI> As part of your project on random variables you wrote a program to estimate the probability mass/density function for a particular random variable that worked by generating a large number of identically distributed random variables.  Now write a program to estimate the cumulative probability distribution function for the same kind of random variable you wrote your project on. </LI> 
              <LI> Suppose that $X$ is a geometric random variable with $p=0.5$.  Now suppose that we generate a random variable $Z$ that is a function of $X$ using $Z = 2^X$.  Write a python notebook that generates multiple instances of this random variable $\{ Z_i \}$.  Draw a graph that shows how the sample mean, $\mu_n = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^n Z_i$, changes as the number of variables it is calculated from increases.  Discuss the behaviour of this sample mean and compare it to the behaviour that you observed for the other random variables you have investigated.  Derive an expression for the expression for the expectation of this random variable and use this expression to explain why the sample mean for this random variable behaves in the way you observe. </LI> 
              <LI> Write a program that generates random variables from a Cauchy distribution.  Generate a large number of identically distributed Cauchy random variables and use this data to estimate the probability density function for your random variable.  </LI>
              <LI> Discuss how Student's-t-distribution arises from sampling and how this distribution differs from the standard normal distribution.  You should write a program that generates random variable from Student's-t-distribution and make sure that you plot the a graph of showing how the shape of the $t$ distribution changes as the number of degrees of freedom is increased. </LI>

     <TITLE> The central limit theorem </TITLE>
     <INTRO>
        <DESCRIPTION>
           The second project in the course is all about the central limit theorem, which is arguably the central theorem in statistics.  Once again you learnt about this theorem in level one but this 
           material is difficult so it bears repeating.  The central idea idea that we are trying to get at with this part of the course concerns using probability theory to develop a numerical measure 
           for the degree of confidence that we have in a particular (quantitative) statement.  The simple version of this idea is that if we have two measurements of some quantity that are very similar 
           we are more likely to believe that each of the individual measurements represent something close to the truth.  We are mathematicians though so we would like to develop a more quantitative version 
           of this intuition.  This is what the central limit theorem allows us to do.

        <TITLE> Monte Carlo Integration </TITLE>
        <DESCRIPTION>
           The method that we have been focussing on using during the blockly and python exercises this week is known as Monte Carlo integration or sometimes importance sampling.
           As I eluded to in the exercises this technique is used a wide variety of different fields of mathematics to calculate integrals.  In all the exercises, however, we have 
           only ever used this method to calculate the expectation of a Bernoulli random variable.  Try to write a python notebook in which you estimate the value of some ofther  
           integral by using Monte Carlo sampling.  This integral might be the expectation/variance of some particularly complicated random variable or it might be some integral 
           that is easy to compute analytically.  To do this you will need to perform some research online on this particular method.  Lastly, note that for whatever integral you 
           choose to perform ensure that you must provide suitable error bars on the numerical estimate that you obtain by Monte Carlo sampling.

     <TITLE> Markov chains in discrete time </TITLE>
     <INTRO>
        <DESCRIPTION>
           In this third project we introduce the Markov property and thus begin our study of random, time-dependent processes.  In this part of the course we assume that we are monitoring our 
           random process at particular points in time rather than assuming we are monitoring the random process continuously.  Furthermore, we assume that the random variable whose value we 
           are monitoring in time can only take integer values.  To describe these processes we introduce the notion of a transition graph and a transition matrix.  You will learn how to write programs
           to simulate Markov chains and will learn how quantitative predictions can be made for these random processes by examining the limiting behavior of the chains.

       <TITLE> Metropolis sampling </TITLE>
       <DESCRIPTION>
         A number of important techniques for calculating integrals are based on the Metropolis sampling algorithm.  Research how this algorithm works and write a program
         to calculate an integral using this technique.  Remember to quote error bars on any estimate that is extracted by calculating a sample mean.  Notice that 
         I will award a higher mark if you explain why the integral you have chosen to perform is useful to calculate.  With this in mind some fields where the Metropolis
         algorithm is used that you might choose to investigate include statistical mechanics (physics) and Bayesian statistics.

     <INTRO>
        <DESCRIPTION>
           The final part of the course takes what you have learnt about discrete time Markov chains and extends it so that it also works in continuous time.  Doing so ensures that we can model processes
           where there are discrete states and where the times between transitions between these states are random.  We can thus use the theory of Markov chains to model processes such as queues and the 
           progression of diseases.  A discussion of Markov chains in continous time also allows us to move beyond the Markovian assumption and to thus introduce more complex time-dependent random processes.

       <TITLE> Field tests for Glaucoma </TITLE>
       <DESCRIPTION>
          Glaucoma is a disease of the eyes that affects old people.  One of the symptoms of this disease is a loss of periferal vision and a narrowing of the patients 
          field of vision.  Patients who have Glaucoma thus undergo regular visual field tests in order to monitor the progress of the disease.  When a person undergoes 
          a field test their head is placed in a machine that resembles a urinal with one eye blindfolded.  The patient stares at an led in the center
          of the machine, while short and sharp burst appear at various points in the remainder of the machine.  The patient must then push a button whenever s/he sees one of these
          bursts of light.

          <UL>
            <LI> Write a program that could be used to control where and when the points of light are generated inside a machine for performing field tests and how bright they are.  Explain how your program addresses the fact that people are primed to recognize regular repeating patterns in the intervals between events when there are repeated stimuli.  This is a problem for field tests as people's subconciouses might lead them to see lights that simply are not there if the timing between each light being generated is too regular. </LI>
            <LI> Write a program that is able to simulate the patients response (pressing the button) in repsonse to each of the light pulses generated by your program.  Discuss what experiments you would need to do on patients in order to determine how to set the parameters in your algorithm for generating light pulses. </LI>

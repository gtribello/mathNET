TITLE: Information theory 

DESCRIPTION:

We define a quantity $I$ (the information) contained in a prob- ability distribution by requiring that this quantity has the following properties (Khinchine)

- The information depends only on the probability distribution 
- The uniform distribution contains the minimum information.
- If we enhance the sample space with impossible events the information does not increase.
- Information is additive

It is possible to show, starting from these axioms, that the information contained in a 
probability distribution that has $N$ possible outcomes in the sample space, $\Omega$, that 
have probabilities given by the vector $\mathbf{p}$, is equal to:
$$
I(\mathbf{p}) = k \sum_{i=1}^N p_i \ln p_i
$$

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to state the Khinchine axioms of information theory
- You should be able to give an expression for the information contained in a uniform distribution.
- You should be able to give an expression for the information contained in a non-uniform distribution.

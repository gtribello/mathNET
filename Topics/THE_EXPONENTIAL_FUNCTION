TITLE: Exponential function

DESCRIPTION:

There are many real life examples of problems where the rate of change of a function at time $t$ is proportional to the 
value of that same functions.  In other words we find the following differential equation in many different contexts:
$$
\frac{\textrm{d}f(x)}{\textrm{d}x} = f(x)
$$
(although often times the $f(x)$ on the right hand side is multiplied by some constant).  If you want examples
of when this comes up think about interest rates, the decay of radioactive isotopes, population growth,...

The solution of this differential equation is:
$$
f(x) = Ae^{x}
$$
In this expression $e^x$ is given by:
$$
 e^x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!}
$$

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to explain why the exponential function is important in many fields of applied mathematics.
- You should be able to solve the differential equation $\frac{\textrm{d}f(x)}{\textrm{d}x} = f(x)$.
- You should be able to write out the McLaurin expansion for $e^{x}$

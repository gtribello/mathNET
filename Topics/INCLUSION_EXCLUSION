TITLE: Inclusion-exclusion principle

DESCRIPTION:

In combinatorics the inclusion exclusion principle is a couting technique which allows 
you to determine the cardinality of the union of two finite sets.  For two sets the 
inclusion-exclusion principle states:

$$
| A \cup B | = |A| + |B| - | A \cup B |
$$

Where $A$ and $B$ are sets and the vertical lines tell us that we are taking the cardinality
of these sets.  The cardinality is the number of elements in the set.

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to state the inclusion exclusion principle.
- You should be able to explain the derivation of the inclusion exclusion principle using Venn diagrams.
- You should be able to explain how the inclusion exclusion principle can be used to calculate probabilities such as $P(X=1 \vee Y=1)$

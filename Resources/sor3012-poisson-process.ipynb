The additional difficulty with the Poisson process comes because the events arrive at random times.  Remember that in discrete-time Markov chains the random events (the transitions) between states happen at fixed points in time.  Regardless of this difficulty, however, it is still possible to write a program to generate events according to a Poisson process.  An example code that does this is given in the cell below."

We know (from what we have learnt in the previous exercises that the time until the next event is now a exponentially-distributed random variable, $W$.  We can thus calculate the time, $T_{n+1}$, at which the next event will occur using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T_{n+1} = T_n + W\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, all we need to do is generate the exponentially distributed random variable $W$ and add it to the input variable Tn or $T_n$ in the above mathematical equations.  We can generate this exponentially distributed random variable by using the continuous analogue of the equation that we used to generate Poisson distributed random variables in the earlier exercises.  If you look at the equations in the above they essentially boiled down to calcualting a uniformly distributed random variable, $U$, and generating an integer random variable, $N$, in accordance with the following rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "N = n \\qquad \\textrm{if} \\quad \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f_N(i) < U < \\sum_{i=0}^{n} f_N(i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where in these expressions $f_N(i)$ is used to denote the probability mass function for the discrete random variable $N$.  In the continuous analogue of this expression the sums are replaced by integrals and the probability mass functions are replaced by probability densities.  We thus have that we can generate a continuous random variable, X, that has probability mass function $f_X(x)$ from a uniform random variable $U$ that lies between 0 and 1 using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X = x \\qquad \\textrm{if}\\quad \\int_{-\\infty}^{x-\\epsilon} f_X(x') \\textrm{d}x' < U < \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} f_X(x') \\textrm{d}x'\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In these expressions $\\epsilon$ is a very small number.  Furthermore, notice that the two integrals are just the cumulative probability distribution function for the random variable $F_X(x)$.  We can thus rewrite the above as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X = x \\qquad \\textrm{if}\\quad F_X(x-\\epsilon) < U < F_X(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, because $\\epsilon$ is a small number we can assume that the range of valid values for $U$ after the if is essentially zero.  We can thus rewrite this expression as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X = F_X^{-1}(U)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $F_X^{-1}(x)$ is the inverse function for the cumulative probability distribution function $F_X(x)$.  <b> In your notes calcualte this inverse function for the exponential random variable.</b>  Remember that the probability mass function for the exponential random variable is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_X(x) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Explain why the code below works based on your derivation and give the value that I have used for $\\lambda$ within the code. </b>  Once you are done press shift and enter on the cell below.  When you have done so a plot of the number of events as a function of time will be shown.  As we have see before you should note that the slope of the above line is nearly linear but that there are deviations around this linear behavior because of the random nature of the process. "

We get this new type of random variable by asking the question \"what happens if the amount of times between events is not distributed according to an exponential distributed random variable.  What would happen if the timings between events was given by a different type of random variable?\"  Clearly, the resulting stochastic process is no longer be Markovian - it is in fact known as a semi-Markov process because what happens during when an event occurs is Markovian.

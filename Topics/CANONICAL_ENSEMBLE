TITLE: The canonical ensemble

DESCRIPTION:

The canonical ensemble is a statistical model that can be used to describe the behavior of a system 
with a constant temperature, a constant number of atoms and a constant volume.  If we have a Hamiltonian, $H(x,p)$,
for the system the canonical partition function can be calculated using:
$$
Z_c = \sum_i e^{-\beta H(x_i,p_i) }
$$
The sum here runs over all the microstates in the system and is replaced by an integral if you have a continuous
rather than a discrete state space.  $\beta$, meanwhile, is equal to one divided by the temperature, $T$, multiplied by 
Boltzmann's constant, $k_B$.  That is to say $\beta = \frac{1}{k_B T}$.  

The probabibility of being with an individual microstate in the canonical ensemble is given by:
$$
p_i = \frac{ e{-\beta H(x_i,p_i) } }{ Z_c }
$$
We can thus calculate the average energy of the system by computing an emsemble average using:
$$
\langle E \rangle = \sum_i H(x_i,p_i) p_i
$$
or by using the analytical result below:
$$
\langle E \rangle = - \frac{ \partial \ln Z }{\partial \beta }
$$
There is a similar result that we can use to calculate the heat capacity:
$$
C_v = \frac{1}{k_B T^2} \langle ( E - \langle E \rangle )^2 \langle = \frac{1}{k_B T^2} \langle \frac{ \partial^2 \ln Z }{\partial \beta^2 }
$$ 

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

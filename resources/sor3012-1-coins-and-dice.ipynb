We are going to use computer programming throughout this course as trying to explain the relevant mathematics to a computer is, in my experience, the best way of learning it.  Computers are very literal and stupid beings who provide you with almost zero margin for error.  This makes them increadibly irritating.  However, if you can explain the maths you want to do to these morons then you probably have a pretty solid understanding of it yourself.\n",

We are using this language mainly because it allows me to write these rather nifty ipython notebooks in which I can explain bits of the task you need to do in boxes like this one.  And provide you bits of code that you will need to make your program work in boxes like this next one."

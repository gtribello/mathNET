  <TITLE> The partition function for molecular gasses </TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>


It is common to assume that there are no intermolecular interactions between molecules when calculating the partition 

function for a molecular gas.  Furthermore, it is also common to assume that the Hamiltonian for the molecules can be 

written as a sum of electronic, $H_e$, translational, $H_t$, rotational, $H_r$ and vibrational, $H_v$, parts as shown below:

$$

H = H_e + H_t + H_r + H_v

$$ 

as if the Hamiltonian can be written in this way the partition function can be written as a product of electronic, 

translational, rotational and vibrational parts:

$$

Z = Z_e \times Z_t \times Z_r \times Z_v

$$

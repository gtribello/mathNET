  <TITLE> Eigendecomposition </TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>


The eigenvalues $\lambda$ and eigenvectors $\mathbf{v}$, of the square matrix $\mathbf{A}$, are the solutions of the equation:

$$

\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}

$$

Many $n \times n$ square matrix, $\mathbf{A}$, will have $n$ eigenvalues and $n$ eigenvectors but some will not.  If all these

eigenvectors exist then the matrix can be rewritten using the following matrix product:

$$

\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{V} \Lambda \mathbf{V}^{-1}

$$

where $\Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix that has the $n$ eigenvalues on its diagonal and where $\mathbf{V}$ is a square matrix

that has the $n$ eigenvectors in its columns.  $\mathbf{V}^{-1} is the inverse of the matrix of eigenvectors, $\mathbf{V}$.

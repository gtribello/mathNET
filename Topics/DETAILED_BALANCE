TITLE: Detailed balance

DESCRIPTION:

Some ergodic Markov chains satisfy a condition known as detailed balance:
$$
\pi_i p_{ij} = \pi_j p_{ji}
$$
where $\pi_i$ and $\pi_j$ are the $i$th and $j$th components of the limiting stationary distribution and $p_{ij}$ and $p_{ji}$ are 
elements of the 1-step transition probability matrix.  In cases where the detailed balance condition holds (you will be told in the exam)
you can use this, rather than Gaussian elimination, to determine a set of simultaneous equations to solve to find the limiting stationary 
distribution.

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to write out the detailed balance condition.
- You should be able to give some examples of Markov chains that do not satisify detailed balance.
- You should be able to use the detailed balance condition to find the stationary distribution of an ergodic markov chain.
- You should be able to explain why the detailed balance condition is important in the context of Markov Chain Monte Carlo.

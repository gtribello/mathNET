TITLE: Molecular dynamics simulation

DESCRIPTION:

Molecular dynamics is a computer simulation method for studying the physical movements 
of atoms and molecules.  In this method the forces between atoms are computed so that the 
positions and velocities of the atoms can be updated using Newton's Laws of motion, which are
solved numerically. 

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to implement the velocity verlet algorithm and thus write your own code for performing molecular dynamics simulations.
- You should be able to explain how the temperature in a molecular dynamics simulation can be kept fixed by using a thermostat.
- You should be able to explain how ensemble averages can be computed from molecular dynamics trajectories.

TITLE: The poisson random variable

DESCRIPTION:

The probability mass function for a Poisson random variable is:
$$
f_X(x) = P(X=x) = \frac{\lambda^x}{x!} e^{-\lambda}
$$
where $\lambda$ is a parameter.  The expectation and variance of this random variable are $\mathbb{E}(X) = \lambda$ and $\textrm{var}(X) = \lambda$.

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to explain how the Poisson distribution can be derived from the binomial distribution in the limit as $n \rightarrow \infty$
- You should be able to write out the probability mass function for the Poisson random variable.
- You should be able to show that the Poisson random variable is properly normalised.
- You should be able to derive the moment generating functions for the poisson random variable and hence obtain the expectation and variance for this random variable

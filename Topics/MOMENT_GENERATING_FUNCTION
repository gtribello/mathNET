TITLE: The moment generating function

DESCRIPTION:

The moment generating function, $M_X(t)$, of a random variable, $X$, is defined as:
$$
 M_X(t) = \mathbb{E}(e^{tX})
$$
You can calculate the $n$th moment of a random variable, $\mathbb{E}(X^n)$ from the moment 
generating function as follows:
$$
 \mathbb{E}(X^n) = \frac{\textrm{d}^n M_X(0)}{\textrm{d}t^n}
$$
In other words the value of the $n$th derivative of the moment generating function at $t=0$ is 
equal to the $n$th moment.

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to explain what is meant by the $n$th moment of a random variable and the $n$th central moment.
- You should be able to write an expression for the moment generating function of both continuous and discrete random variables.
- You should be able to explain how to calculate the $n$th moment of a random variable from the moment generating function.
- You should be able to derive the moment generating functions for Binomial and Poisson random variables.

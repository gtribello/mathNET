TITLE: Combinatorics

DESCRIPTION:

If we have $n$ distinguishable objects (i.e. $n$ things that we can tell apart) 
then there are $n!$ different ways we can order these objects.  

If we have $n$ objects and only 
$r$ of them are distinguishable - in other words if our $n$ objects contain 
$(n-r)$ copies of the same item - then there are $\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$ ways of 
ordering these objects.  
To be clear these  $\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$ arrangements of the objects are the ones 
we can tell apart.  Obviously, if we swap the indistinguishable items we get the 
same pattern and thus it is not possible to distinguish between the two arrangements.  

If we have $n$ objects: $r$ objects of one type and $(n-r)$ objects of a second different 
type, then there are $\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$ distinct ways of ordering our objects.

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should understand what we mean when we state that two objects are distinguishable and when objects are indistinguishable.
- You should be able to explain why there are $n!$ ways of arranging $n$ distinguishable objects.
- You should be able to explain why there are $\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$ ways of arranging $n$ objects if only $r$ of them are distinguishable
- You should be able to explain why there are $\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$ distinct ways of ordering $r$ objects of one type and $(n-r)$ objects of a second different type

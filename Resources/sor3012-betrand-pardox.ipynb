    "# Understanding the probability distribution function\n",
    "\n",
    "You were taught early on in your education about the classical interpretation of probability (See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEzLR-tReEY).  This classical interpretation is the maths that we use when we calculate the probability of getting heads when we toss a coin or the probability of getting two sixes when we roll two fair dice.  In this course (and elsewhere at university) matters have been confused by introducing the Bayesian and Frequentist interprettations of probability. You may quite reasonably ask why these interpretations are necessary given that we have the classical interpretation to fall back on.  The answer to this question is that the classical interpretation does not work in all cases.  In particular, and as discussed in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbbTEZ4NlCI, it breaks down when we have continuous random variables.  To resolve this problem we have introduced the cumulative probability distribution function $F_X(x)$ and stated that this function equals:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_X(x) = P(X \\le x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the cumulative probability distribution function measures the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to $x$.  Furthermore, we have required that this function has the following three properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\lim_{x \\rightarrow -\\infty} F_X(x) = 0 \\qquad \\lim_{x \\rightarrow +\\infty} F_X(x) = 1 \\qquad \\lim_{\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0} F_X(x + \\epsilon) = F_X(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this video we are going to do some exercises to better get to grips with the implications of this realisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Revision\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we are going to use what we have learnt about the law of large numbers once more.  Remember this theorem states:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} P\\left( \\left|\\frac{S_n}{n} - \\mathbb{E}(X) \\right| < \\epsilon \\right) = 0 \\qquad \\textrm{where} \\qquad S_n = X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + \\dots\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this expression $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$ and so on are all independent and identically distributed random variables.  In other words, these variables are the (random) outcomes from a set of identical experiments that have been performed.  The quantity $S_n$ is, therefore, the sum of all these random variables and in the expression on the left this is divided by the number of experiments to give us the mean.  The symbol $\\mathbb{E}(X)$ is the expectation of the random variable.  For the discrete random variables we have looked at this far the expectation is given by the following summation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}(X) = \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty x_i f_X(x_i) \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous exercise on the law of large numbers we showed that we could use the law of large numbers to calculate the expectation of a random variable (if it exists).  We do this by calculating $N$ instances of the random variable, adding them all together and dividing by $N$.  This is the essence of the technique we will use here.  The main difference from other exercises is that the business of calculating the random variables is going to be a little more involved.  Regardless, however, we will use all the dynamic plotting functionality we used in the law of large numbers exercise.  The relevant functions are in the cell below so press shift and enter on this cell now."

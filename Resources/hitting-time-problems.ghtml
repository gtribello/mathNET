TITLE: Discrete markov chains with absorbing states

DESCRIPTION:

In these exercises we consider Markov chains that have a mixture of transient and 
absorbing states.  In problems of this type the aim is almost always to calculate the
probability of finishing in each of the absorbing states and to calculate the expected
number of steps till absorbtion.

EXERCISE: Time to absorbtion

A discrete random variable, $X$, can take the values $X \in \{0,1,2\}$
according to a discrete Markov Process described by the transition matrix:
$$
\mathbf{P} = \left(
\begin{matrix}
 0.6 & 0.1 & 0.3 \\
 0.2 & 0.2 & 0.6 \\
 0 & 0 & 1 
\end{matrix}
\right)
\nonumber
$$
Find the hitting times for each of the transient states in this
chain. That is find the expected number of steps required until absorption
occurs. 

EXERCISE: Multiple absorbing states

A Markov chain, between the states $X=0,1,2,3,4$,
 is  described by the following  transition matrix:
$$
\left(
\begin{matrix}
0.1 & 0.2 & 0.3 & 0.4 & 0  \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0  & 0 \\
0.2 & 0.1 & 0.4 & 0.2 & 0.1\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{matrix}
\right) 
$$
Draw the transition graph for this chain, and show that $X=0,2$ are transient states.
Once you have done this Partition the transition matrix so that
$$
P =
\left(
\begin{matrix}
Q & R \\
0  & I \\
\end{matrix}
\right) 
\qquad ,
$$ 
with $Q$  connecting the transient states so that you can Calculate the  
hitting probability matrix:
$$
h = (I-Q)^{-1}R \qquad ,
$$
and the hitting times.  These hitting times should tell you the expected number of steps 
starting from the transient states, until absorption occurs.

EXERCISE: Markov university 

A university introduces a new mathematics degree structure. The course is
only two years long but students have to resit a year if they fail their final
examinations.  Students also have the option to resit the first and second
years if they feel they did particularly poorly during year 2.  In any given
year students perform as follows in the two years:

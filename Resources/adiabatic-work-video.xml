      <b> Before watching the video </b> explain what what it means when we state that a transition takes place adiabatically.
    </LI>
    <LI> 
      Now watch the video and answer the following questions.
    </LI>
    <LI> 
      Why does the piston head apply a force on the gas and how is this force connected to the pressure applied on the gas
    </LI>
    <LI> 
      Write an expression for the work done when the piston head moves upwards by an amount $\Delta x$ and hence derive an expression 
      for the amount of work done when a gas expands by an amount $\Delta V$.
    </LI> 
    <LI> 
      Explain why the quantity that you arrived at in the previous question has a negative sign in front of it?
    </LI>
    <LI> 
      Referring back to earlier answer to this comprehension answer the following question.  When can this expression be used to calculate the 
      work done when a gas expands?  In other words, does this this equation give you the work done whenever a gas expands?

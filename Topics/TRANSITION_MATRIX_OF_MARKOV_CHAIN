TITLE: Markovian transition matrix

DESCRIPTION:

The transition matrix for a Markov chain with $n$ states is an $n\times n$ square matrix in which the $i,j$ element gives you 
the conditional probability of being in state $j$ at time $t+1$ if you are in state $i$ at time $t$.  

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to interpret the elements of the transition probability matrix by making reference to the Markov property.
- You should be able to extract transition probabilities between states from the transition probability matrix.
- You should be able to draw the transition graph when given the transition probability matrix.
- You should be able to write out the transition proability matrix when given the transition graph.

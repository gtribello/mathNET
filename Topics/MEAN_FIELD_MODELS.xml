  <TITLE> The mean field approximation </TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>


The mean field approximation is a technique that can be used to calculate approximate partition functions for systems composed 

of interacting particles.  The problem with calculating such partition functions exactly comes when one attempts to enumerate

all the possible microstates and calculate their energy.  This combinatorial problem is too expensive to solve by brute force 

and is impossible to solve for complex Hamiltonians.  In mean field theory the $N$-body system is thus replaced by a 1-body system

that sits in a suitably chosen external field.  This external field is set equal to the average field due to the 

remaining particles.   In essence mean field theory is an approximation technique that allows us to map a multi-body problem onto 

a one-body problem.  Similar techiniques appear in many different fields within physics and are often given different names.

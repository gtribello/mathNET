TITLE: Monte Carlo Simulation

DESCRIPTION:

Monte Carlo is one of a very small number of integration algorithms that can be used to 
calculate integrals over large numbers of variables.

This method is used widely in atomistic simulation, where it used to calculate ensemble averages,
and also in statistics where it can be used to calculate expectations for particular complex random 
variables.

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to explain and implement the metropolis sampling algorithm.
- You should be able to explain how ensemble averages can be computed using Monte Carlo simulations.
- You should be able to explain how problems with ergodicity affect the accuracy of the ensemble averages calculated using Monte Carlo

  <TITLE>Detailed Balance
</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>
In solving the following problems you will use the detailed balance condition:
$$
\pi_i p_{ij} = \pi_j p_{ji}
$$
to find the limiting staionary distribution for a Markov chain.  Markov chains 
with limiting stationary distributions don't always satisfy detailed balance 
so you need to take care when using this method for finding the stationary distribution.
If you are in any doubt use the method based on finding the top eigenvector.

    <TITLE>A first problem
</TITLE>
    <PROBLEMS>Consider the  reversible  Markov chain, between the states 
$X=0,1,2,3$,  represented  by  the following transition matrix. 
$$
P=
\left(
\begin{matrix}
0.5   &amp;  0.5  &amp; 0 &amp;    0  \\
 0.05 &amp;  0.45 &amp; 0.5 &amp; 0 \\
0     &amp;  0.1 &amp;  0.5 &amp;  0.4  \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp;  0.3  &amp;  0.7 \\
\end{matrix}
\right) \qquad .
$$
Draw the {\em transition graph} for this process and use the 
detailed balance condition to find the stationary distribution, $\pi$.
Once you have calculated $\pi$ use it to verify that this is the 
stationary distribution by showing that $\pi P = \pi$.  Then use
the ergodic theorem to calculate the recurrence time (expected return time) 
for state $X=2$.

    <TITLE>A big chain
</TITLE>
    <PROBLEMS>Consider the  reversible  Markov chain, between the 
states $X=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8$,  represented  by  the following matrix. 
$$
P=
\left(
\begin{matrix}
 0&amp; 1/2&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 1/2&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0\\ 
 1/3 &amp; 0 &amp;1/3&amp; 0&amp; 1/3&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0 \\
 0&amp; 1/2 &amp;0 &amp;1/2&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp;0 &amp; 1/3&amp; 0 &amp;1/3&amp; 0 &amp;0 &amp;0 &amp;1/3\\ 
 0&amp; 1/4&amp; 0 &amp;1/4&amp; 0&amp; 1/4&amp; 0&amp; 1/4 &amp;0\\ 
 1/3&amp; 0 &amp;0&amp; 0&amp; 1/3&amp; 0&amp; 1/3&amp; 0&amp; 0 \\
 0&amp; 0 &amp;0 &amp;0 &amp;0 &amp;1/2&amp; 0&amp; 1/2&amp; 0 \\
 0&amp; 0 &amp;0&amp; 0&amp; 1/3 &amp;0 &amp;1/3&amp; 0 &amp;1/3\\ 
 0 &amp;0&amp; 0&amp; 1/2&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 1/2&amp; 0   \\
\end{matrix}
\right) \qquad .
$$
Draw the transition graph for this process (hint: start by drawing a 3 x 3 grid
of nodes with 0, 5 and 6 on the top row 1,4 and 7 on the second row and 2,3 and
8 on the bottom row).  Then use the detailed balance condition to find the 
stationary state and the ergodic theorem to calculate the fraction of time that the system spends 
in state $X=6$ and the expected return time for state 3. That is, the expected number of 
steps, starting from state $X=3$, until the system returns to state 3 
for the first time.

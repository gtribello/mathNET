TITLE: The isothermal isobaric ensemble

DESCRIPTION:

The isothermal isobaric ensemble is a statistical model that can be used to describe the behavior of a system
with a constant temperature, a constant number of atoms and a constant pressure.  If we have a Hamiltonian, $H(x,p)$,
for the system the isothermal-isobaric partition function can be calculated using:
$$
Z_i = \sum_i e^{-\beta H(x_i,p_i) } e^{-\beta P V(x_i,p_i) }
$$
The sum here runs over all the microstates in the system and is replaced by an integral if you have a continuous
rather than a discrete state space.  $\beta$, meanwhile, is equal to one divided by the temperature, $T$, multiplied by
Boltzmann's constant, $k_B$.  That is to say $\beta = \frac{1}{k_B T}$.

The probabibility of being with an individual microstate in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble is given by:
$$
p_i = \frac{ e^{-\beta H(x_i,p_i)} e^{-\beta P V(x_i,p_i) } }{ Z_i }
$$
We can thus calculate the average volume of the system by computing an emsemble average using:
$$
\langle V \rangle = \sum_i V(x_i,p_i) p_i
$$
or by using the analytical result below:
$$
\langle V \rangle = -\frac{ \partial \ln Z_i }{\partial (\beta P) }
$$
There is a similar result that we can use to calculate the isothermal compressibility:
$$
\kappa_T = -\frac{1}{V} \left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial P} \right)_T = \frac{k_B T}{\langle V \rangle} \left\langle ( V - \langle V \rangle )^2 \right\rangle = \frac{1}{\langle V \rangle} \left( \frac{ \partial^2 \ln Z }{\partial (\beta P)^2 } \right)
$$

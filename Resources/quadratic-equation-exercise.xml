  <DESCRIPTION>
    A quadratic equation:
    \[
    f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c
    \]
    is shown plotted in green in the graph above.  The sliders allow you to control the values of the $a$, $b$ and $c$ parameters.
    Answer the questions below by experimenting with the sliders.
  </DESCRIPTION>
  <UL>
    <LI> Describe the shape of the quadratic curve.  If $a=0$ is the equation still a quadratic? </LI>
    <LI> Describe the shape of the curve when $a \gt 0$ and when $a \lt 0$. </LI>
    <LI> Consider a quadratic equation in which $b=0$.  What effect does changing the value of $c$ have on the curve?  What effect does changing the value of $a$ have? </LI>
    <LI> If $f(x) = x^2$ then $f(0)=0$.  Setting $a=1$ can you find values of $b$ and $c$ so that $f(1)=0$, $f(-1)=0$?  Can you generalise this and write expressions for the coefficients $b$ and $c$ in terms of the $\alpha$ value for which $f(\alpha) = 0$?  Can you find some form other than $ax^2 + bx + c$ in which we might write <b> these particular quadratics </b> ? </LI>
    <LI> Thinking about your answer to the previous question what other forms have we used to express quadratic equations?  Take a quadratic expressed in this form, convert it to $ax^2 + bx + c$ form and use the sliders to plot the graph of this function.  What do you notice about the points where the curve crosses the $x$ axis?  Explain why the curve crosses the x-axis at these particular points? </LI>
    <LI> Suppose you were now given a quadratic equation and asked to sketch the curve.  What four things would it be important to indicate in your diagram?  </LI>
    <LI> Use the information in the textbook and describe how you would determine each of the four things that you identified in the previous question. </LI>

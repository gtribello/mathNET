    "In this exercise we are going to learn how to write a computer program that estimates the probability mass function for an unknown discrete random variable.  We are then going to modify this idea so that we can also esimtate probability densities and thus work with unkown continuous random variables.  Once this is done we will look at sums of random variables, which will bring us to our first encounter with the central limit theorem.  \n",

    "In a previous exercise we introduced the law of large numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} P\\left( \\left|\\frac{S_n}{n} - \\mathbb{E}(X) \\right| < \\epsilon \\right) = 0 \\qquad \\textrm{where} \\qquad S_n = X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + \\dots\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this expression $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$ and so on are all independent and identically distributed random variables.  In other words, these variables are the (random) outcomes from a set of identical experiments that have been performed.  The quantity $S_n$ is, therefore, the sum of all these random variables and in the expression on the left this is divided by the number of experiments to give us the mean.  The symbol $\\mathbb{E}(X)$ is the expectation of the random variable.  For the discrete random variables we have looked at this far the expectation is given by the following summation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}(X) = \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty x_i f_X(x_i) \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous exercise we showed that we could exploit the law of large numbers and estimate the expectation for a random variable by generating a large number of random variables from a distribution.  We then added these $N$ random variables together and divided by $N$ in order to get our estimate of the expectation.  The essence of this exercise is to exploit the same idea to estimate the probability mass function.  Now though instead of calculating the expectation for the random variable we calculate a set of expectation values of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "g_X(x_i) = \\mathbb{E}[\\delta( X- x_i)]\n",

    "0 & \\textrm{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This expectation thus measures the fraction of times that the random variable $X$ is equal to $x_i$.  If we do this for each of the possible values that $X$ can take we get an estimate of the probability mass function.  This is the basis of calculating a histogram a technique that you have most certainly encountered before.  Can you see why?\n",

To be clear in the programs we have written thus far we have used python as if it is a procedural language so the building blocks of our programs have been variables that hold data and functions that change the values of these variables.  In the object oriented program below, by contrast, the building blocks are bundles of variables and functions called classes.  When we use this style of programming we have to do two things:\n",

    "The reason I mention this is because it is important to understand in terms of understanding the flow of the code.  In essence everything in the function called \\_\\_init\\_\\_ is called first as this is done when the object is created.  The functions in buildHistogram are then run second.  Within buildHistogram the variables with names like self.ycount are variables that belong to the class.  Hence, the initial values for these variables are set in \\_\\_init\\_\\_.  The values of these variables are then used or modified in buildHistogram.  "

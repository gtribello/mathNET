  <DESCRIPTION>


A quadratic function is any function having the form:

$$

f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c 

$$

where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are parameters and where $a \ne 0$.  Quadratics can be written

in a range of forms.  A very important result is the equation for the roots of the 

qudaratic (the points where $f(x)=0$).  This equation is:



$$

x = \frac{ -b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} }{2 a} 

$$

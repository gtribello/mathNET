  <TITLE> Inclusion-exclusion principle </TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>


In combinatorics the inclusion exclusion principle is a couting technique which allows 

you to determine the cardinality of the union of two finite sets.  For two sets the 

inclusion-exclusion principle states:



$$

| A \cup B | = |A| + |B| - | A \cup B |

$$



Where $A$ and $B$ are sets and the vertical lines tell us that we are taking the cardinality

of these sets.  The cardinality is the number of elements in the set.

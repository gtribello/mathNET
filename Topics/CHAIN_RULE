TITLE: Chain Rule

DESCRIPTION:

The derivative of a function of a function, i.e. $f(x) = g[h(x)]$, with respect to $x$ is given by the chain rule:
$$
\frac{\textrm{d}f(x)}{\textrm{d}x} = \frac{\textrm{d}g[h(x)]}{\textrm h(x)} \frac{\textrm{d}h(x)}{\textrm{x}}
$$

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to write out the chain rule.
- You should be able to use the chain rule to find the derivatives of functions of functions.
- You should be able to use the chain rule in tandem with the product rule to find the derivatives of complicated function.

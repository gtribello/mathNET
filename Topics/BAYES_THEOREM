TITLE: Bayes theorem

DESCRIPTION:

Bayes theorem is a commonly used theorem in statistics.  This theorem states that:

\[
 P(X=1|Y=2)P(Y=2) = P(Y=2|X=1)P(X=1)
\]

This equality stems from the fact that $P(X=1|Y=2)P(Y=2)$ and $P(Y=2|X=1)P(X=1)$ are just two different ways of writing $P(X=1 \wedge Y=2)$ 
as you can see by looking at the definition of conditional probability.

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should understand the derivation of Bayes theorem.
- You should be able to use Bayes theorem to interpret probabilisitc information.

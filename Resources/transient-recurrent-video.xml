    <LI> How is the return time to a state defined.</LI>
    <LI> What is the distinction between the transient and the recurrent states in a Markov chain.</LI>
    <LI> Draw an example of a Markov chain with one transient state and one recurrent state.</LI>
    <LI> Draw transition graphs for two Markov chains with one transient and two recurrent states that have different limiting behaviors</LI>
    <LI> Draw an example of a Markov chain with 3 recurrent states and 4 transient states.</LI>

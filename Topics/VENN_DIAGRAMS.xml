Set theory is the branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which informally are

collections of objects.  This theory begins by introducing a fundamental binary relation between an

object $o$ and a set $A$.  We write that $o \in A$ if the object $o$ is in the set $A$ and

$o \notin A$ if the object $o$ is not in the set $A$.  If all the members of the set $B$ are 

in $A$ we say that $B$ is a subset of $A$ and write $B \subset A$.  Any members of the subset $A$ 

that are not in $B$ are said to belong to the complement set $B^c$.  



Just as arithmatic features binary operators on numbers set theory features binary operations on sets.  

If we have two sets $A$ and $B$ two particularly important operations of the sets are the union $A \cup B$ 

and the intersection $A \cap B$.  $A \cup B$ includes all objects that are members of $A$, $B$ or both, while

to be a member of $A \cap B$ an object must be a member of both $A$ and $B$.

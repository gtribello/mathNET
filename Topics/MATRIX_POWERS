TITLE: Taking positive integer powers of a square matrix

DESCRIPTION:

We can calculate the second power of a square matrix, $\mathbf{A}$, by multiplying it by itself:
$$
(A^2)_{ij} = \sum_k A_{ik} A_{kj}
$$
If we thus multiply the square of the matrix, $\mathbf{A}^2$, by $\mathbf{A}$ we get the cube of a matrix.
We thus arrive at the following general rule:
$$
\mathbf{A}^{n+m} = \mathbf{A}^n \mathbf{A}^m \qquad \forall n,m > 0
$$

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to explain how the powers of a square matrix are calculated.
- You should be able to write a python program that calculates the powers of a matrix by performing matrix multiplications.
- You should be able to write a program for calculating the powers of a diagonal matrix that scales linearly with the size of the matrix.
- You should be able to write a program that expoits the eigendecomposition of a square matrix in order to calculate matrix powers quickly.

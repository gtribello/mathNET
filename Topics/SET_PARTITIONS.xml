  <DESCRIPTION>


If we have a set $\Omega$ a partition, $\{ A_k \}$, of $\Omega$ is a set 

of $n$ subsets of $\Omega$ that have the following properties:



$$

 A_j \cap A_j = \emptyset \quad \forall \quad i \ne j \qquad \textrm{and} \qquad \bigcup_{j=1}^n A_j = \Omega

$$



Here $\emptyset$ is the empty set $\cap$ denotes the intersection of two sets and $\bigcup$ denotes the union of the $n$ sets in the partition.

  <TITLE> Summation and product notation </TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>


When working with sums of large numbers of terms e.g.

$$

a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 + a_8 + a_9 + a_10 

$$

we use the following shorthand

$$

\sum_{n=1}^{10} a_n

$$

rather than writing out all the terms individually.  Similarly if we are evaluating the product of many terms:

$$

a_1 \times a_2 \times a_3 \times a_4 \times a_5 \times a_6 \times a_7 \times a_8 \times a_9 \times a_10

$$

we use the shorthand:

$$

\prod_{n=1}^{10} a_n

$$

In both these notations the variable $n$ over which we sum or take products is referred to as the dummy variable or index.

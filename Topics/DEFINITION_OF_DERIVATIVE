TITLE: Differentiation

DESCRIPTION:

If we have a function $F(x)$ then its derivative, $\frac{\textrm{d}F(x)}{\textrm{d}x}$, is defined as:
$$
\frac{\textrm{d}F(x)}{\textrm{d}x} = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \frac{ F(x+\epsilon) - F(x) }{ \epsilon }
$$

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to write out the definition of the derivative.
- You should be able to find the derivatives of functions by taking the above limit.  
- You should be able to find the derivatives of $x^n$ and $e^{\lambda x}$ with respect to $x$.

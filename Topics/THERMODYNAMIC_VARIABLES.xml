  <DESCRIPTION>


The thermodynamic variables are the macroscopic quantitis that describe the state of the system.  Many of these quantities can be easily mesaured 

or controlled in experiments.  There is an important distinction between <b> extensive </b> thermodynamic variables such as volume, which have 

values that depend on the number of atoms/mols that are present in the system, and <b> intensive </b> thermodynamic variables such as pressure and

temperature, which have values that do not depend on the number of atoms/mols in the system.  A system is said to be in equilibrium if the thermodynamic

variables that characterize the state of that system do not change over macroscopic timescales.  When two phases are in equilibrium the intensive 

thermodynamic variables that characterize state of the two phases must be equal.

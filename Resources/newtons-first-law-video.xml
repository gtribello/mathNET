    <LI> Before watching the video explain what you understand the physics terms <b> the system</b>, <b> the environment</b>,<b> a state of the system</b>,<b> a force</b> and <b> a derivative</b> to mean.</LI>
    <LI> What does Newton's first law state?</LI>
    <LI> What did I say defines the state of a system in Newtonian mechanics?</LI>
    <LI> How did I say we define change in physics?  Describe what types of processes constitute change in Newtonian physics?</LI>
    <LI> Having now watched the video what do you understand the physics terms<b> the system</b>, <b> the environment</b>,<b> a state of the system</b>,<b> a force</b> and<b> a derivative</b> to mean.</LI>

  <DESCRIPTION>


In probability theory and statistics, the continuous uniform distribution or rectangular distribution is a family of probability 

distributions such that for each member of the family, all intervals of the same length on the distribution's support are equally 

probable.  The probability distribution function for this random variable is:

$$

F_X(x) = \frac{x-a}{b-a}

$$

where $b$ and $a$ are parameters that give the highest and lowest (real) values that the random variable can take.  The probability density

function for this random variable is:

$$

f_X(x) = \frac{1}{b-a}

$$

and the expectation and variance are $\mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{1}{2}(a+b)$ and $\textrm{var}(X) = \frac{1}{12}(b-a)^2$.

  <DESCRIPTION>


A differential equation is said to be separable if the variables can be separated.  That is, a 

separable equation is one that can be written in the form:

$$

\textrm{d}f = g(x) \textrm{d}x

$$



The general solution to these types of differential equations is:

$$

f(x) = \exp\left( -\int_0^x g(x') \textrm{d}x' \right)

$$

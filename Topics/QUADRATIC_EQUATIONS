TITLE: Quadratic functions

DESCRIPTION:

A quadratic function is any function having the form:
$$
f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c 
$$
where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are parameters and where $a \ne 0$.  Quadratics can be written
in a range of forms.  A very important result is the equation for the roots of the 
qudaratic (the points where $f(x)=0$).  This equation is:

$$
x = \frac{ -b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} }{2 a} 
$$

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to factorise quadratics and multiply out factorised quadratics.
- You should be able to find the roots of a quadratic equation.
- You should be able to find the intercept for a quadratic equation.
- You should be able to complete the square in order to find the location of the minimum/maximum for a quadratic equation.
- When given the equation of a quadratic you should be able to draw a sketch of the graph and indicate where the graph crosses the $x$ and $y$ axis and the location of the minimum/maximum for the curve.

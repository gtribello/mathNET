TITLE: Gaussian Elimination

DESCRIPTION:

The system of linear equations involving the unknown vector $\mathbf{x}$, 
the known vector $\mathbf{b}$ and the square invertible matrix $\mathbf{A}$;
$$
\mathbf{Ax}=\mathbf{b}
$$
can be solved using Gaussian elimination. During this process the matrix
$\mathbf{A}$ is converted to upper-triangular form.  The elements of
$\mathbf{x}$ and then found by back-substitution.

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to use Gaussian elimination to solve systems of two to three linear equations using pen and paper.
- You should be able to use appropriate python libaries to solve systems of equations involving large numbers of linear equations using Gaussian elimination.

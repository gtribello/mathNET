    <LI> Before wathcing the video try to explain what you understanding the following physics terms to mean <b>conservative vector field</b>, <b>energy</b>, <b>potential</b> and <b>how are potentials and forces related</b></LI>
    <LI> <b>Now watch the video and answer the following questions</b></LI>
    <LI> What does Newton's third law state.</LI>
    <LI> Can you explain why in the video I insist that action is not the same as force.</LI>
    <LI> If the momentum of a system increases by $\Delta p$ what is the corresponding in the change of momentum in the environment?</LI>
    <LI> Explain what is meant by the term conservative vector field.  How much does the momentum of a particle change by when it moves around a circular path in a conservative vector field.</LI>
    <LI> How is the kinetic energy calculated from the momentum.  How is this expression derived?  Is energy a scalar of a vector quantity making sure that you justify your answer?</LI>
    <LI> Explain why we introduce the notion of potential energy rather than considering the kinetic environment of the environment explicitly.</LI>
    <LI> How are forces related to potentials?</LI>

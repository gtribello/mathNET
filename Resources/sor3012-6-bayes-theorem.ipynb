It is not that introducing probability makes the outcomes of individual experiments more predictable.  The outcomes from individual experiments are random variables that cannot be predicted exactly and probability offers little help in this regard.  The utility of probability stems from certain limits theorems in particular the law of large numbers (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCdcPSkqgUk) and the central limit theorem (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XJe3s_BCKw).

    "<i> Consider a test to detect a disease that 1% of the population have.  The test is 99% effective in detecting an infected person.  However, the test gives a false positive result in 5% of cases.  If a person tests positive for the disease what is the probability that they actually have it? </i>\n",

In other words, we are going to use the information in the question to generate a large population of individuals.  We are then going to exploit the law of large numbers to calculate the required probability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in solving the problem in this way involves thinking carefully about what the characterises each individual person in this question.  When we do this we realise that, for the purposes of the question, each person is simply a pair of random variables.  These two random variables tells us:\n",

    "- Whether or not the person got a positive test result, $T$.\n",

Obviously, no person can simultaneously have and not have the disease.  Similarly, when they take the test it returns either a positive or negative result.  It does not simultaneously return both a positive and negative result.\n",

    "- If the person is amongst the 1% of the population who have the disease ($D=1$) the chance they will have a positive test result ($T=1$) is equal to 99%. \n",

    "In the plot produced the green line shows the number of individuals who tested positive for the disease but who are actually healthy.  The blue line meanwhile shows the number of individuals who tested positive for the disease and who are actually sick.  The $x$-axis shows how many people have been tested in total.  As you can see from the graph the number of people with positive test results represents only a small fraction of the 1000 people who were tested.  Furthermore, false positives (green line) far outnumber those sick individuals who were identified by the test.  The reason for this is (roughly speaking) connected to the fact that 5% of the 99% of healthy individuals is much more than 99% of the 1% of sick individuals.  \n",

This is an important thing to know as in reality we would not know if the person had the disease or not. We are doing the test, after all, to identify sick individuals.  In the next exercise I would thus like you to modify the code in the cell above so that our <b> estimate </b> for the probability of a positive test result is plotted rather than the number of positive test results for the healty and diseased individuals.  For this reason I have put more of the internals of dynamicplot into the above box.  In particular I have shown you how the data points that are plotted on the graph are generated using the function plot.  There are comments within the code that explain what each of the important variables are used to represent.  The coordinates that are plotted on the graph appear after the yield command.  The $x$ and $y$ values for the blue line are the variables in the above code named cnt and nh.  The $x$ and $y$ values for the blue line, meanwhile, are cnt and nd.  We wish to modify this yield command so that the esimtate of the probability of having the disease if you test positive is plotted rather than the numbers.  Hint: you will need to exploit the law of large numbers here.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Think carefully as the change you need to make is relatively small.  In addition, dynamicplot  is robust enough to deal with the fact that you are only plotting one line in the new graph rather than one (you can thus have yield with only two values after it rather than three as in the above). In addition, the extent of the axes will also be dealt with automatically.  You do need to be careful not to divide anything by zero however.\n",

TITLE: Inhomogeneous Poisson Process

DESCRIPTION:

The inhomogeneous Poisson Process is similar to an ordinary Poisson process.  The main difference is that 
in an inhomogeneous Poisson Process the average rate of arrivals is allowed to vary with time.  This is useful 
as many applications that generate random points in time are modelled more faithfully when these non-homogeneous 
processes.

To understand the derivation of the inhomogeneous Poisson process we can start by introducing something akin to the 
jump rate matrix.  However, because the rate of arrivals is now a function of time, the elements of this matrix are now
functions rather than numbers as shown below.
$$
\mathbf{Q}(t) = \left(
\begin{matrix}
-\lambda(t) & \lambda(t) & 0 & 0 & 0 & \dots \\
0 & -\lambda(t) & \lambda(t) & 0 & 0 & \dots \\
0 & 0 & -\lambda(t) & \lambda(t) & 0 & \dots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots
\end{matrix} 
\right)
$$
This matrix can be inserted into the following differential equation:
$$
\frac{\textrm{d}\mathbf{P}}{\textrm{d}t } = \mathbf{P}(t) \mathbf{Q}(t)
$$
which is akin to the Kolomogorov equation.  When the matrix equation above is multiplied above 
the resulting family of differential equations for the probabilities of having $n$ events during a time window of length $t$ 
can be solved giving: 
$$
p_n(t) = \frac{(\int_0^t \lambda(t) \textrm{d}t')^n}{n!} e^{-\int_0^t \lambda(t) \textrm{d}t'}
$$

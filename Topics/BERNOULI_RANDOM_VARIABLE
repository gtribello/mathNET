TITLE: Bernoulli random variable

DESCRIPTION:

The Bernoulli random variable is a discrete random variable that is often used to model experiments that have only two outcomes.
These types of experiments are sometimes called trials.  The probability mass function for the Bernoulli random variable is:

$$
f_X(x) = P(X=x) = \begin{cases}
 1-p  & \textrm{if} \quad x=0 \\
 p & \textrm{if} \quad x=1 \\
 0 & \textrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

The expectation for a Bernoulli random variable, $X$, is $\mathbb{E}(X) = p$ and the variance is $\textrm{var}(X) = p(1-p)$.

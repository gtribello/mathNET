  <TITLE> Statistical Mechanics </TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>
     Statistical mechanics is a formalism that aims to explain the physical properties of matter at the
     macroscopic level by considering the dynamical behaviour of matter's microscopic constituents - atoms and molecules.
     The scope of the formalism is almost unlimited as it is applicable to matter in any state of aggregation,
     ranging from gases, liquids and solids to matter in equilibrium with radiation and biological specimens.
     The aim of this course is to introduce the basic principles and methods of statistical mechanics and to
     apply them to a number of model systems in order to illustrate their use and potential in a systematic manner.
     
     We start by introducing the fundamentals of thermodynamics and then proceed to develop the concepts
     and techniques needed to evaluate probability distributions and partition functions. This later quantity
     establishes the link between the microscopic description of a system, based on quantum states or positions in phase space,
     and the macroscopic characterisation provided by a small set of independent thermodynamic variables.  We discuss a number 
     systems where the partition function can be calculated exactly and then show how we can use this function to rationalise 
     the behavior of the constituent particles in these system at the microscopic and macroscopic scales.  Ultimately, however,
     the exact solution for the partition function cannot be found for the majority of real systems of interest.  In the last
     part of the course we therefore discuss how approximate ensemble averages are found by exploiting approximations or numerical
     simulation techniques.

        <CALL> What is a thermodynamic variable? </CALL>
        <RESPONSE> A thermodynamic variable is a quantity that describes the state of a macroscopic system.  Many of these quantities can be easily measured or controlled in experiments. </RESPONSE>
     </ITEM>
     <ITEM> 
         <CALL> What property do extensive variables have? </CALL>
         <RESPONSE> If the value of a thermodynamic variable depends on the size of the system then it is said to be an extensive quantity.  The values of extensive quantities depend on the number of atoms (mols) that are present in the system. </RESPONSE>
      </ITEM>
     <ITEM>
         <CALL> What property do intensive variables have? </CALL>
         <RESPONSE> If the value of a thermodynamic variable does not depend on the size of the system then it is said to be an intensive quantity.  The values of intensive quantities do not depend on the number of atoms (mols) that are present in the system.  The density of an extensive variable (e.g. Number of atoms in a volume) is an intensive quantity.  Quantities that are intrinsically intensive (i.e. not densities of extensive quantities) are also called {\bf fields.}  </RESPONSE>

         <CALL> What does it mean when we state that a system is in an equilibrium state? </CALL>
         <RESPONSE>  A system is said to be at equilibrium if it does not change over macroscopic timescales.  At equilibrium extensive variables do not change in time and intensive variables take on a single, uniform value across the whole system.  Equilibrium states are completely characterised by a small set of thermodynamic variables. </RESPONSE>

         <CALL> What do we mean by an isolated system? </CALL>
         <RESPONSE> An isolated system cannot exchange heat, work or matter with its environment </RESPONSE>
     </ITEM>
     <ITEM>
         <CALL> What do we mean by a closed system? </CALL>
         <RESPONSE> A closed system cannot exchange matter with its environment.  It can, however, exchange both heat and/or work. </RESPONSE>
     </ITEM>
     <ITEM>
         <CALL> What do we mean by an open system</CALL>
         <RESPONSE> An open system can exchange heat, work or matter with its environment </RESPONSE>
     </ITEM>
     <ITEM>
         <CALL> What are the properties of an exact differential? </CALL>
         <RESPONSE> 
            If a quantity $F(x)$ is an exact differential then the change in $F$ that occurs when one travels from state point $x_A$ to state point $x_B$ does not 
            depend on the path taken between $x_A$ and $x_B$.
         </RESPONSE>
     </ITEM>
     <ITEM>
         <CALL> What does the first law of thermodynamics state? </CALL>
         <RESPONSE>  The first law of thermodynamics states:
                      \[
\textrm{d}E = d\hspace{-0.75ex}\rule[1.25ex]{1.5mm}{0.4pt}q + d\hspace{-0.75ex}\rule[1.25ex]{1.5mm}{0.4pt}w 
\]
In other words we measure the change in internal energy by adding together the work done one the system and the heat absorbed by the system.
         </RESPONSE>
     </ITEM>
     <ITEM>
         <CALL> What does the second law of thermodynamics state? </CALL>
         <RESPONSE>  The second law of thermodynamics states: 
\[
\Delta_{A\rightarrow B} S \ge \int_A^B \frac{\textrm{d}q}{T}
\]
The equality sign holds when the transition is reversible, the inequality holds when the transition is irreversible.  A consequence of this law is that the entropy of an isolated system can never decrease.
     </RESPONSE>
     </ITEM>
     <ITEM>
         <CALL> What is the combined statement of the first and second laws of thermodynamics? </CALL>
         <RESPONSE>  When the first and second laws of thermodynamics are combined we arrive at the following expression for change in internal energy $\textrm{d}E = T\textrm{d}S - P\textrm{d}V$ </RESPONSE>
     </ITEM>
     <ITEM>
         <CALL> How is the enthalphy defined? </CALL>
         <RESPONSE>  The enthaply, $H$, is equal to $H = E + PV$ </RESPONSE>
     </ITEM>
     <ITEM>
         <CALL> How is the Helmholtz free energy defined? </CALL>
         <RESPONSE>  The Helmholtz free energy, $F$, is defined as $F = E - TS$ </RESPONSE>
     </ITEM>
     <ITEM>
         <CALL> How is the Gibbs free energy defined? </CALL>
         <RESPONSE>  The Gibbs free energy, $G$, is defined as $G = E + PV - TS$ </RESPONSE>
     </ITEM>
     <ITEM>
         <CALL> What is the difference between a first order and a continuous phase transition? </CALL>
         <RESPONSE>  In a first order phase transition there is a discontinuity in the first derivative of the thermodynamic potential at the phase boundary.  In a continous phase transition the first derivative of the thermodynamic potential is continuous but a discontinuity in one of the higher order derivatives still ensures that the change in the thermodynamic potenital cannot be expressed using a Taylor series if the transition crosses the phase boundary. </RESPONSE>
     </ITEM>
     <ITEM>
         <CALL> Explain the meanings of the terms microstate and phase space. </CALL>
         <RESPONSE> Any physical system can adopt one of a number of microstates.  For a quantum system these are the various quantum levels.  For a classical system these are the various combinations of velocities and positions for the atoms in the system.   Phase space is the set of all possible microstates that a system can adopt.</RESPONSE>
     </ITEM>
     <ITEM>
         <CALL> State the axioms of information theory and give an expression for the information. </CALL>
         <RESPONSE>  
We  define a quantity $I$ (the information) contained in a probability distribution by requiring that this quantity has the following properties (Khinchine)
\begin{itemize}
\item The information depends only on the probability distribution. 
\item The uniform distribution contains the minimum information.
\item If we enhance the sample space with impossible events the information does not increase.
\item Information is additive.
\end{itemize}
It is possible to show, starting from these axioms, that the information contained in a probability distribution that has $N$ possible outcomes in the sample space, $\Omega$, that have probabilities given by the vector $\mathbf{p}$, is equal to:
\[
I(\mathbf{p}) = k \sum_{i=1}^N p_i \ln p_i
\]

         <CALL> Describe the canonical ensemble </CALL>
         <RESPONSE> 
            In the canonical ensemble the number of atoms, the volume and the temperature are fixed.  The probability of being in a 
            particular microstate is:
$$
p_i = \frac{ e^{-\beta E_i} }{ Z } 
$$
and the partition function is:
$$
Z = \sum_i e^{-\beta E_i}

     </ITEM>
     <ITEM>
         <CALL> Describe the isothermal isobaric ensemble </CALL>
         <RESPONSE>  
            In the isothermal isobaric ensemble the number of atoms, $N$, the pressure, $P$, and the temperature, $T$, are fixed.  The probability of being in a
            particular microstate is:
$$
p_i = \frac{ e^{-\beta E_i} e^{\beta P V_i }}{ Z } 
$$
and the partition function is:
$$
Z = \sum_i e^{-\beta E_i}e^{-\beta PV_i}
$$
</RESPONSE>
     </ITEM>
     <ITEM>
         <CALL> Describe the grand canonical ensemble </CALL>
         <RESPONSE>  
            In the grand canonical ensemble the chemical potential, $\mu$, the volume, $V$, and the temperature, $T$, are fixed.  The probability of being in a
            particular microstate is:
$$
p_i = \frac{ e^{-\beta E_i} e^{+\beta \mu N_i }}{ Z }
$$
and the partition function is:
$$
Z = \sum_i e^{-\beta E_i}e^{+\beta \mu N_i}
$$
         </RESPONSE>
     </ITEM>
     <ITEM>
         <CALL> Describe the microcanonical ensemble </CALL>
         <RESPONSE>  
            In the microcanonical ensemble the number of atoms, $N$, the volume, $V$, and the internal energy, $E$, are fixed.  The probability of being in a particular 
            microstate is:
$$
p_i = \frac{ \delta(E_i-E)\delta(V_i-V)\delta(N_i-N) }{ \Omega }
$$
            The partition function, $\Omega$, for this ensemble is simply the total number of states that have energy $E$, volume $V$ and number of atoms $N$.  In other words:
$$
\Omega = \sum_i \delta(E_i-E)\delta(V_i-V)\delta(N_i-N)
$$

        <TITLE> Self study </TITLE>
        <DESCRIPTION>
            The first component of the assessment is based on how you have studied for the module.  Each week you must use this report to answer the following questions:

            \begin{itemize}
            \item To what extent did you achieve the aims that you set for yourself in the previous week?  If you did not achieve your aims what went wrong and what are you going to do differently this week?

            \item What am I aiming to work through this week?  If you achieved all your aims last week how have you made your aims more ambitious this week?
            \end{itemize}

            The report should be about {\bf half an a4 page} in length.  Please do not give a narative account of what you read/watched/solved during the week.  Notice, finally, that I may also email you with 
            specific questions to answer in your report in certain weeks.

        <DESCRIPTION>
           The second project of the assessment is based on some programming exercises that you must perform.  This exercise leads you through some key ideas that we use to 
           understand the simulations that we perform on physical systems.  You must produce python notebooks that contain the code that you used to solve these problems.
           In addition, you should provide some short explanation as to what the code that you have written is doing within the notebook using the markup language.  You can 
           find descriptions and markschemes for the projects on the mathNET website.  This assignment is marked out of five and the expectation is that you should all be 
           getting close to full marks as getting a high mark in this exercise is mostly a question of following the instructions that are given.

        <DESCRIPTION>
          The third component of the assessment is based on a number of longer form problems.  In answering these problems you will need to write continuous prose answers that have a substantial length.  
          These pieces of continuous prose will contain some mathematics but if your answers contain mathematics with no explanation you will be given a very low mark.  The principle aim in writing 
          these essays is for you to demonstrate that you have some physical understanding of the equations that you are writing.  All essays should be typeset using latex.

Student writes an essay on an aspect of statistical mechanics that he/she has investigated independently.  The essay is properly referenced and factually correct.  Please discuss any topic that you would like to 
investigate with me beforehand.  Furthermore, please note that a poorly argued and pooly structured essay on something that is outside the module content will get a very low mark.  In other words, high marks are not 
automatically awareded for investigating something that was not covered in class.  For the highest marks there is an expectation that you use what you have learnt from your self study to solve a problem that you have 
identified yourself.  If you simply reproduce standard derivations that can be found in a textbook this will get a mark of around 8-9.

        <DESCRIPTION>
           In this chapter you will learn about classical thermodynamics.  You will learn about the extensive and intensive variables that we use to characterise 
           the state of the system in this theory and about how can understand the ways these state functions change by using relatively simple partial differential
           equations.  You will then learn about the laws of thermodynamics and how we can use these laws to construct thermodynamic potentials, Maxwell relations and
           inequalities involving response functions.  These last inequalities are particularly important as these are the concrete predictions that allow us to test
           whether or not this body of theory correctly describes reality.

     <INTRO>
        <DESCRIPTION>
           In this chapter you will begin to learn about statistical mechanics.  Before delving too deeply into the theory you will do some computer programming 
           exercises that will help you better understand the terminology and methods of statistical mechanics.  You will be introduced to a number of simple 
           Hamiltonians for lattice systems and will learn how to calculate ensemble averages and partition functions for these systems using both analytic methods
           and numerical methods.  The principle aim of these exercises is to get used to the notion of a microstate and the notion that the state of the system 
           includes information on the probability of being in each microstate.

           In this chapter you will learn the theoretical underpinnings of the statistical thermodynamics that you started to study in the previous chapter more rigorously.
           You will learn about the principle of equal apriori probabilities that underpins this theory and about the relationship between the entropy in statistical 
           mechanics and the information in information theory.  You will then learn how we can construct a generalized partition function by performing a constrained 
           optimization of the information.  You will then see how we can use this generalized ensemble to construct thermodynamic ensembles that can be used to describe 
           systems that are under a variety of different constraints on intensive and extensive quantities.  To consolidate all that you have learnt you will learn how we
           can create models that describe interacting and non-interacting gases and adsorption of molecules on surfaces.  Lastly, you will learn about the statistical 
           mechanics of first and second order phase transitions.

           This final chapter of the module gives you the opportunity to understand something about modern research on statistical mechanics.
           The primary focus is on the field of atomistic simulation and the method known as molecular dynamics in particular.  We will, however, 
           also discuss work in other fields that has been inspired by these recent developments in the simulation of atoms and molecules.  The 
           organisation of this part of the module is different from the first three chapters.  Instead of having a set syllabus that you have to 
           work through each of you will be given an article to read.  You are then expected to give a presentation on the content of the article 
           and to write a report on the article.  The purpose of this approach is to give you some experience of how research work differs from 
           undergraduate work and to encourage you to begin the process of having conversations about research papers with supervisors and with your
           peers.

TITLE: Thermodynamic Potentials

DESCRIPTION:

A thermodynamic potential is a scalar, extensive quantity that can be used to represnet the thermodynamic state of a system.
The first thermodynamic potential you are typically introduced to is the internal energy and from the first and second laws
of thermodynamics we know that, in a system that can only do PV work, infinitessimal changes in internal energy can be 
calculated using:
$$
\textrm{d}E = T\textrm{d}S - P\textrm{d}V
$$
New themodynamic potentials are introduced by considering a system in contact with a reservoir.  Some important thermodynamic 
potentials include:
$$
begin{aligned} 
\textrm{Enthalpy} & \qquad H = E + PV \\
\textrm{Helmholts free energy} & \qquad F = E - TS \\
\textrm{Gibbs free energy} & \qquad G = E + PV - TS \\
\textrm{Grand potential & \qquad \Omega = E - TS - \sum_i \mu_i N_i  
\end{aligned}
$$
The differentials of these quantities are:
$$
\textrm{Enthalpy} & \qquad \textrm{d}H = T\textrm{d}S + V\textrm{d}P \\
\textrm{Helmholts free energy} & \qquad F = -P\textrm{d}V - S\textrm{d}T \\
\textrm{Gibbs free energy} & \qquad G = V\textrm{d}P - S\textrm{d}T \\
\textrm{Grand potential & \qquad \Omega = -P\textrm{d}V - S\textrm{d}T - \sum_i N_i \textrm{d}\mu_i 
\end{aligned}
$$
It is possible to use these results, together with the fact that all thermodynamic potentials are exact differentials, 
to relate all the thermodynamic variables to partial derivatives of thermodynamic potentials.

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to give the definitions for the enthalpy, helmholtz free energy, gibbs free energy and grand potential.
- You should be able to derive expressions for infinitessimal changes in the enthalpy, helmholtz free energy, gibbs free energy and grand potential.
- You should be able to to explain what requirements are placed on the change in Helmholtz free energy for spontaneous processes in a closed system with constant volume and constant temperature. You should also be able to explain what requirements are placed on the change in Gibbs free energy for a spontaneous processes in a closed system with constant pressure and constant temperature.

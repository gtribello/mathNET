TITLE: Transient and recurrent states in Markov chains

DESCRIPTION:

A state in a Markov chain is said to be transient if:
$$
P(R_i \le \infty ) < 1
$$
and recurrent if
$$
P(R_i \le \infty ) = 1
$$
Here $R_i$ is the return time to state $i$, which is random as this quantity measures the number of steps in a loop that starts and 
end in state $i$.

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to write out and explain what makes states in a Markov chain recurrent and what makes them transient.
- You should be able to classify the states in a Markov chain as transient or recurrent.
- You should be able to describe the limiting behavior of a Markov chain by examining the transition graph.

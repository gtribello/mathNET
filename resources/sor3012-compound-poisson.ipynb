    "The Compound Poisson Process is an example of Hidden Markov Process.  A hidden Markov process is like a Markov chain but now we receive a random signal when we arrive in each state rather than a signal that tells us that we are in state $n$.  We can understand this statement in terms of the Compound Poisson Process as follows.  Suppose we have just have a regular Poisson process and we monitor the number of events, $N(t)$, that have occured by time $t$.  For the Poisson process we know the state that we are in at all times. If $N(t)$ is equal to $K$ then there have been exactly $K$ events and we are thus in state $K$.  Now suppose instead that we have a Compound Poisson Process that models the ammount of money spent on amazon.com as a function of time.  By time $t$ there have been $N(t)$ events (i.e. $N(t)$ purchases).  We, however, do not know this as we do no know how many events have occured - we only have information on the total ammount spent $Y(t)$.  In other words, the signal (the ammount spent by each customer) that is given each time there is an event (a purchase) and a change of state is random.  The underlying Markov chain (the Poisson Process) is thus hidden.\n",

    "To answer this question lets return to our old tricks.  We will simulate a Poisson process for a fixed period of time.  This will generate a random variable $N_t$.   By repeating this exercise multiple times we will get an estimate for the mean of our random variable using the law of large numbers.  We can then do the same exercise for the compound Poisson process.  With this in mind press shift and enter on the cell below, which contains some tools that we are now familiar with.  These tools allow us to plot a graph showing how our esimtate of the mean changes as we perform more experiments (simulate more time windows in this case). "

After all in the last two exercises we showed that the expectation, $\\mathbb{E}[Y(t)]$, for a Compound Poisson process, $Y(t)$, with rate $\\lambda$ and mean $\\mu$ is the same as the expectation, $\\mathbb{E}[N(t)]$, of a regular Poisson process, $N(t)$, with rate $\\lambda\\mu$.  Why then don't we model Compound Poisson Processes using a regular Poisson process with a suitably-scaled rate parameter?  Furthermore, (and returning to our original question) how can we determine that a process is a Compound Poisson process if we are just given information on how $Y(t)$ changes with time?  We will find an answer to these questions by considering the variance for the Poisson and Compound Poisson Processes.

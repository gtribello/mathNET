TITLE: Gamblers ruin

DESCRIPTION:

Gamblers ruin is a problem involving a particular discrete time Markov chain.
The transition matrix for the Gamblers ruin problem is the following $(N+1) \times (N+1)$ 
square matrix:
$$
M = \left(
\begin{matrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
q & r & p & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & q & r & p & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & q & r & p \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{matrix}
\right)
$$
where $q + r + p = 1$.  This chain has ($N-1$) transient states and two recurrent states so 
solving this problem ammounts to finding hitting times and hitting probabilities.  What makes
this particular chain interesting is that the symmetry of the matrix ensures that it is possible to 
find the hitting probabilities by solving a homogeneous difference equation.  Furthermore, we can find the 
hitting times by solving an inhomogenous difference equation.   When these two probelms are solved we find that
the conditional probability, $\pi_k$, of finishing in state $0$ given that we start in state $k$ is given by:
$$
\pi_k = \frac {\left( \frac{q}{p}\right)^k - \frac{q}{p}\right)^N }{ 1 - \frac{q}{p}\right)^N } 
$$
The expected time to arrival in either state $0$ or state $N$ given that we start in state $k$ is by contrast:
$$
d_k = \frac{k}{q-p} - \frac{N\pi_k}{q-p}
$$
Notice that these equations are NOT valid in the limit when $q=p$ and that l'Hopital's rule must be used to find
the probabilities in this limit.

  <DESCRIPTION>


The normal random variable is one of the most important random variables in statistics.

Its particular importance is due to the implications of the central limit theorem.



The probability density function for the normal distribution is:

$$

f_X(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left( - \frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right)

$$

where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are parameters. The expectation and variance for this random variable 

are $\mathbb{E}(X) = \mu$ and $\textrm{var}(X) = \sigma^2$

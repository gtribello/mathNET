TITLE: The generalized partition function

DESCRIPTION:

A partition function describes the statistical properties of a system in thermodynamic
equilibrium.  Partition functions are functions of the thermodynamic state variables
such as the temperature and volume.  Each partition function is constructed to represent
a particulr statistical ensemble.  We can derive a generalized form for the partition function 
by requiring that, if each of the microstates in phase space has some set of properties $\{b^{(j)}\}_i$,
 (a volume, energy, number of atoms, etc) the ensemble average for each of these properties $\langle B^{(j)} \rangle$ 
should be finite.  In other words:
\[
\sum_i p_i b^{(j)}_i = \langle B^{(j)} \rangle
\]
We can then use Lagrange's method of undetermined multipliers to derive the probability of being in a 
microstate as:
\[
p_i = \frac{e^{-\sum_j \lambda^{(j)} b^{(j)}_i}}{Z} 
\]
where $Z$ is the partition function, which is given by:
\[
Z =  = \sum_i e^{-\sum_j \lambda^{(j)} b^{(j)}_i} 
\]

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to explain the meanings of the terms microstate and phase space.
- You should be able to state the principle of equal apriori probabilities in statistical mechanics.
- You should be able to use Lagrange's method of undetermined multipliers to derive the generalised partition function.
- You should be able to explain how entropy and information are related.
- You should be able to write an expression for the entropy of a uniform distribution and the entropy for the generalised ensemble.
- You should be able to write an expression for the infinitesimal change of entropy that occurs when the constrained extensive variables are changed by an infinitesimal amount.
- You should be able to differentiate the generalised partition function (and functions thereof) with respect to $\lambda_k$ and $\alpha^{(j)}$

TITLE: Gibbs Phase rule

DESCRIPTION:

The requirement that all intensive variables must be homogenous (equal) across the entirety of the system when the system is at equilibrium ensures that <b> at equilibrium</b> not all thermodynamic quantities are independent.  In particular, there is a result called Gibb's phase rule which states:
$$
F = C - \pi + 2
$$
Here $C$ is the number of components in the system (i.e. the number of chemically distinct species), $\pi$ is the number of phases in the system (i.e. the number of distinct regions of space in the system where the properties of the material are essentially uniform) and $F$ is the number of thermodynamic variables that are independent.  

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to explain the meaning of the word phase in thermodynamics.
- You should be able to explain what happens to the intensive and extensive thermodynamic variables in a two phases system as it comes to equilibrium.
- You should be able to state Gibbs phase rule and give an explanation how this result is derived.

TITLE: Newtons Laws of Motion

DESCRIPTION:

Newton's three laws of motion are the bedrock upon which classical mechanics is built.
These three laws state:

<ul>
<li> A body remains at rest or travelling at a constant speed unless acted upon by an external force. </li>
<li> The force acting on a body is equal to the rate of change of the bodies momentum </li>
<li> Every action has an equal and opposite reaction </li>
</ul>

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to state Newton's law of motion.
- You should be able to explain how the terms system, envinroment and state are used to mean in classical mechanics.
- You should be able to write out a mathematical statement of Newton's second law using a derivative.
- You should be able to explain the connection between Newton's third law and the conservation principles that are at the heart of physics.
- You should be able to explain what we mean when we refer to a potential in physics and how forces can be calculated from potentials.

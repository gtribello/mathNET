  <DESCRIPTION>


The linear equation for the unknown vector $\mathbf{x}$, involving the

known vector $\mathbf{b}$ 

and the matrix, $\mathbf{A}$, with rank less than the dimension of $\mathbf{b}$;

$$

\mathbf{Ax}=\mathbf{b}  \quad ,

$$

has a general solution that  can be written in terms of the homogeneous solution

(null-space/kernel  vector) and the particular solution:

$$

\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x}_{\rm homo}+\mathbf{x}_{\rm part}

$$

where:

$$

\mathbf{Ax}_{\rm homo}=0 \qquad, \qquad \mathbf{Ax}_{\rm part} =\mathbf{b} \quad

.

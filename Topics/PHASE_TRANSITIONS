TITLE: The theory of phase transitions

DESCRIPTION:

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to explain what distinguishes a first-order phase transition and a continuous phase transition by making reference to the first and higher derivatives of thermodynamic potentials.
- You should be able to discuss how an infinite 1D-closed Ising model undergoes a phase transition at $T=0$ if there is no applied magnetic field.
- You should be able to use the transfer matrix approach to calculate the average spin for a closed 1D-Ising model.
- You should be able to use the transfer matrix approach to calculate the covariance of the spins in a closed 1D-Ising model.

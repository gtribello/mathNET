TITLE: Exponential growth/decay

DESCRIPTION:

Exponential growth/decay occurs whenever you have a first-order
differential equation of the form:
$$
{d p \over dx} = \lambda p(x)
$$
The solution of this equation is:
$$
p(x) = Ae^{\lambda x}
$$

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to determine from a description of a phenomonon when it is appropriate to model a process using an expoential growth/decay model.
- You should be able to solve the differential equations that are used to describe exponential growth/decay.
- You should be able to determine the coefficient, $A$, for exponential growth/decay by making use of the boundary conditions given in the statement of the problem.
- You should be able to fit time series to an exponential growth/decay model.

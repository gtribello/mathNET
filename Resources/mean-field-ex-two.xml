  <DESCRIPTION>
     The green line shows the free energy, $F$, expressed as a function of the average magnetization, $\langle M \rangle$, for 
     a mean field description of the 1D Ising model in the thermodynamic limit.  The black line is the first derivative of this 
     free energy with respect to the
     magnetization, $\langle M \rangle$.  There are two sliders the first allows you to control the strength of the magnetic field, 
     $H$, which is expressed in units of the interaction constant for the spins, $J$.  The second slider allows you to control the 
     inverse temperature, $\beta$,  which is expressed in units of $\frac{J}{k_B T}$

    <LI>  What is significant about the points where the black curve intercepts with the $x$ axis? </LI>
    <LI>  When the applied field $H$ is equal to 0 at how many points does the black line intercept with the $x$ axis?  What happens as the the inverse temperature is increased? </LI>
    <LI>  Describe the shape of the green curve when $H=0$ and when (a) $T \lt 0.5$ and when (b) $T \gt 0.5$.  How does the shape of this curve differ in these two regimes?  What happens to the derivative of the free energy with respect to $\langle M \rangle$ at $H=0$ when $T=0.5$? </LI>
    <LI>  What happens to the shape of the green curve when $H \ne 0$.  Comment on the behavior of the turning points and the way this number changes with field strength and temperature. </LI>
    <LI>  Given what you have discussed explain how the magnetization behaves as you move from the $T \gt 0.5$ regime to the $T \lt 0.5$ regime in the absense of an applied field </LI>
    <LI>  How does the magnetisation behave as the temperature is increased in the presence of an applied magentic field? </LI>

TITLE: Differential equations and integrating factors

DESCRIPTION:

The first-order (ordinary linear) differential equation:
$$
{d y \over dx} + p(x) y = q(x) \qquad ,
$$
can be rearranged using an {\em integrating factor}, into the form:
$$
{ d \over dx} \left(  y(x)  \ e^{ \int p\  dx } \right)  = \ e^{ \int p\  dx }
q(x)  \qquad , 
$$
The solution of this differential equation is then:
$$
y(x) =  \ e^{- \int p  \ dx } \times \int  e^{ \int p\ dx}  \ q(x)  \ dx  \qquad
.
$$

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to determine when it is appropriate to use the integrating factor method to solve a differential equation.
- You should be able to explain why the integrating factor method works by making reference to the product rule.

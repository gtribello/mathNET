TITLE: Statistical mechanics of independent-distinguisable systems

DESCRIPTION:

In statistical mechanics the particles in the system are said to be distinguishable if the microstate the system is in 
is changed if the labels of two particles are exchanged.  The particles in such systems generally sit on lattice sites
much like the atoms in a solid.  These particles are said to be independent if there is no interaction between them.  
If a system is composed of non-interacting particles that are sat on lattice sites it is straightforward to calculate
the partition function as the $N$-particle partition function is equal to the 1-particle partition function raised to 
the power $N$.

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to enumerate all the configurations in phase space for a lattice gas and for the adsorption gas on a surface.
- You should be able to calculate the canonical partition functions for a lattice gas.
- You should be able to calculate ensemble averages for lattice gasses.

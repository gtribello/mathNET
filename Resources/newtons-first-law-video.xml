    <LI> Before watching the video explain what you understand the physics terms <b>the system</b>, <b>the environment</b>, <b>a state of the system</b>, <b>a force</b> and <b>a derivative</b> to mean.</LI>
    <LI> <b>Now watch the video and answer the following questions</b></LI>
    <LI> What does Newton's first law state?</LI>
    <LI> What did I say defines the state of a system in Newtonian mechanics?</LI>
    <LI> How did I say we define change in physics?  Describe what types of processes constitute change in Newtonian physics?</LI>
    <LI> Having now watched the video what do you understand the physics terms <b>the system</b>, <b>the environment</b>, <b>a state of the system</b>, <b>a force</b> and <b>a derivative</b> to mean.</LI>

TITLE: Enhanced sampling

DESCRIPTION:

A problem arises when Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics is used to sample energy landscapes that contain
high energetic barriers.  The random moves in these methods are generally small local moves.  That is 
to say the moves generally do not take the system from one local minimum to another. This is a problem 
as the probability that the system will cross any energetic barriers by making these local moves is very 
low.  Thankfully a number of enhanced sampling algorithms exist that can be used to force these barrier 
crossing events to occur in relatively short simulation timescales.  Many of these methods work by introducing
additional bias terms into the Hamiltonian.

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to explain how simulation biases are used to force the system to sample different parts of configuration space.
- You should be able to list a range of different enhanced sampling techniques and discuss the relative merits and demerits of each one.

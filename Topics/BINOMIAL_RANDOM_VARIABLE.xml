  <DESCRIPTION>


The binomial random variable is a discrete random variable that is used to model the outcome from 

a set of $n$ identical experiments that have one of two possible outcomes which are often referred to as sucess and 

failure.  The Binomial random variable tells you the number of sucessful experiments that were performed.



The probability mass function for the Binomial random variable is given by:



$$

f(X=x) = P(X=x) = \binom{n}{x} p^{x} (1-p)^{n-x}

$$



The expectation for this variable is $\mathbb{E}(X)=np$ and the variance is $\textrm{var}(X) = np(1-p)$.

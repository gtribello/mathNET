TITLE: Lagrange multipliers

DESCRIPTION:

The method of Lagrange multipliers is a method for finding an optimum in a function subject to 
some equality constraints.  As an example this method can be used to find an optmum in the function
$f(x,y)$ subject to the constraint $g(x,y)=a$.  This method does so by introducing a new variable
$\lambda$ called a Lagrange multiplier.  The extended function $L(x,y,\lambda)$ below is then 
introduced:
$$
L(x,y,\lambda) = f(x,y) - (\lambda - a)g(x,y)
$$ 
is then introduced.  It can then be shown that the values of $x$ and $y$ in the unconstrained opimum 
for $L(x,y,\lambda)$ are the same as the values of $x$ and $y$ at the constrained optimum in $f(x,y)$ 

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to use Lagrange's method of undetermined multipliers to perform an optimization of a $N$-dimensional function subject to $M$ constraints

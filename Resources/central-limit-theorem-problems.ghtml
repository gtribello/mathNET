TITLE: Central limit theorem

DESCRIPTION:

The central limit theorem states that for a set of independent and
identically distributed random variables, $X_1$, $X_2$, $\dots$ the following
holds: 
$$
 \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} P\left( \frac{S_n/N - 
\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{N}} \le z \right) = \Phi(z)
$$
where $N$ is the number of random variables and $S_n = X_1 + X_2 + \dots$.
In the above expression $\mu=\mathbb{E}(X)$ and 
$\sigma^2=\textrm{var}(X)$ so obviously this expression cannot be used if your
random variable has either $\mathbb{E}(X)=\infty$ or $\textrm{var}(X)=\infty$.

In doing the following exercises you will learn how to extract probabilistic
information about the sums of independent and identical random variables 
using the central limit theorem.

EXERCISE: Exercise 1

Consider a sequence of discrete random variables, $\{X_1,X_2, \dots , X_n \}$, that 
are independent, identically-distributed, each with mean $\mu$ and 
variance $\sigma^2$. Recall that the central limit theorem, for the sample
variable, $S_n$, where: $S_n=X_1+X_2+ \cdots + X_n$, can be expressed as:
 $$
 \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}
 P \left( {S_n/n -\mu  \over \sigma /\sqrt{n}} \leq x \right) = \Phi(x)  \quad ,
 $$
 where $\Phi(x)$ is the standard normal probability distribution function.

<li> Analysis of commuter travel  shows that the number of passenger per car, $X$, 
is a discrete random variable with independent, identical distributions, such that 
$\mathbb{E}(X)=1.2$ and $\textrm{var}(X) = 1.0$.  Use the central-limit theorem  to estimate 
the probability that, in a sample of $n=100$ cars, the total number of passengers is 140 or fewer. </li>
<li> The share price of SOR plc  varies in  a random manner, such that 
the price increase each minute is described by a discrete 
random variable  $X$ (measured in pounds), with the following probability mass:
$$
f_{X}(x) =
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
0.5   & \quad , \quad  x=+0.05  \\ 
0.2  & \quad , \quad x=\ \ \ 0.00  \\
0.3   & \quad , \quad  x=-0.05  \\
\end{array}
\right.
$$
Calculate $\mathbb{E}(X)=\mu$ and $\sqrt{\textrm{var}(X)}=\sigma$ and hence use the central limit 
theorem to estimate the probability  that the price will increase by Â£1.20 , or more,  after 3  hours. </li>
</ul>

EXERCISE: Exercise 2

During the course of a single season a particular football player has 213 penalty attempts and scores 175 of them. 
Given this information calculate the probability he will score during his next penalty attempt and explain the 
assumptions that you have made in your calculation. Please give appropriate error bars for a 95 % confidence 
level on your numerical estimate.

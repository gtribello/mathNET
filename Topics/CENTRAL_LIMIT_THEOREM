TITLE: The central limit theorem

DESCRIPTION:

The central limit theorem states that for a set of independent and 
identically distributed random variables, $X_1$, $X_2$, $\dots$ the following 
holds: 
$$
 \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} P\left( \frac{S_n/N -
\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{N}} \le z \right) = \Phi(z)
$$
where $N$ is the number of random variables and $S_n = X_1 + X_2 + \dots$. 
In the above expression $\mu=\mathbb{E}(X)$ and 
$\sigma^2=\textrm{var}(X)$ so obviously this expression cannot be used if your 
random variable has either $\mathbb{E}(X)=\infty$ or $\textrm{var}(X)=\infty$.

The central limit theorem is used to interpret the results from a set of experiments.
Each experiment generates a random variable $X_k$, and we assume that the 
random variables generated by each of these experiments have the same 
underlying probability distribution function (they are identical) and each of 
these random variables is independent (the outcome of one experiment does not 
affect the outcomes of other experiments).  

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to state the central theorem without proof.
- You should be able to explain why the central limit theorem is useful and how it is used when interpretting the results from multiple experiments.
- You should be able to explain when the interpretation of multiple experiments offered by the central limit theorem breaks down.
- You should be able to use the central limit theorem to calculate confidence intervals.

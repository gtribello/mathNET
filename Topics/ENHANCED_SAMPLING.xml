  <DESCRIPTION>


A problem arises when Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics is used to sample energy landscapes that contain

high energetic barriers.  The random moves in these methods are generally small local moves.  That is 

to say the moves generally do not take the system from one local minimum to another. This is a problem 

as the probability that the system will cross any energetic barriers by making these local moves is very 

low.  Thankfully a number of enhanced sampling algorithms exist that can be used to force these barrier 

crossing events to occur in relatively short simulation timescales.  Many of these methods work by introducing

additional bias terms into the Hamiltonian.

  <TITLE> Geometric series </TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>


In mathematics a geometric series is a series with a constant ration between successive terms.  For example:

$$

\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} + \dots

$$

The sum of a geometric series with $n$ terms is given by:

$$

\sum_{i=0}^{n} x^{i}= 1+x+x^{2}+ \cdots + x^{n} = 

{1-x^{n+1} \over 1-x}

$$

If  $\vert x \vert &lt; 1$:

$$

\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x^{i}= 1+x+x^{2}+ \cdots + x^{n} + \cdots  =

{1 \over 1-x} \qquad .

$$

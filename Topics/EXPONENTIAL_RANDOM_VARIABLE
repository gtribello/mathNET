TITLE: Exponential random variable

DESCRIPTION:

The exponential random variable is the continuous analogue of the geometric distribution.
This random variable has the key property of being memoryless meaning that the exponential
random variable $T$ has the following property:
$$
P(T>t+s)=P(T>t)P(T>s)
$$
The exponential random variable is the solution of the Kolmogorov equation for the two-state
jump rate matrix:
$$
\mathbf{Q} = \left(
\begin{matrix}
 -\lambda & \lambda \\
 0 & 0
\end{matrix}
\right)
$$
The probability distribution function for this random variable is:
$$
F_T(t)= P(T\le t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
$$
while the probability density is:
$$
f_T(t) = \lambda e^{-\lambda t}
$$
The expectation and variance of this random variable are $\mathbb{E}(T)=\frac{1}{\lambda}$ and $\textrm{var}(T) = \frac{1}{\lambda^2}$

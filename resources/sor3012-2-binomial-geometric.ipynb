If you go online you will find that other kind people have written intrinsic functions for python that generate these kinds of random variables.  <b>Please do not use these functions as it defeats the point of the exercise</b>, which is to code these things yourself and to understand how these variables can be constructed by performing a set bernoulli trials.  <b>Read the instructions provided carefully and if you don't understand ask.</b>\n",

Writing a function to generate numbers from a binomial distribution should thus simply be a matter of generating multiple bernoulli random variables using the function that you copied from the first exercise.  With this in mind use the cell below to write a python function that generates random numbers from the binomial distribution.  This function should take as its argument the parameter $p$ in the above expression and the number of trials $n$.  <b>Remember not to use an intrinsic function or the solutions that you find online</b>.

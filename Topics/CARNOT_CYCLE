TITLE: The Carnot Cycle

DESCRIPTION:

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to describe the transitions that take place during the Carnot cycle and the work and heat that is transferred between the gas in the piston and its surroundings during these transitions.
- You should be able to explain why the Carnot engine is the most efficient engine that can be constructed.
- You should be able to explain how Kelvin's universal calibration for temperature is constructed using considerations based on the Carnot cycle.

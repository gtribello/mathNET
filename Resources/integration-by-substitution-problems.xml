  <TITLE>Integration by substitution
</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>
When looking at the following problems remember that when using integration by substitution you must change three
things; namely:
<ul>
<li> The limits if it is a definite integral. </li>
<li> The integrand </li>
<li> The infinitessimal (often $\textrm{d}x$) </li>
</ul>
When you look at the worked examples and at the problems start by trying to work out how these things have been done
or how they should be done.

    <TITLE>Exercise 1

    <PROBLEMS>Find the following indefinite integral (hint: use the substitution $u=x-1$)
$$
\int \frac{x^2 + 1}{x-1} \textrm{d}x
$$

    <TITLE>Exercise 2

$$

    <TITLE>An exercise based on probability theory
</TITLE>
    <PROBLEMS>Suppose the continuous random variable, $X$, has the Cauchy probability distribution, defined by the 
probability density:
$$
f_X(x) = \frac{a}{\pi(a^2 + x^2)} \qquad -\infty \lt x \lt + \infty 
$$
where, $a > 0$ is a constant. Use the substitution $x=a\tan t$ to verify that $\int_{-\infty}^\infty f_X(x) \textrm{d}x = 1$. 
Hint: remember that $1+\tan^2(t) = sec^2(t)$.

    <LI> List as many thermodynamic variables as you can</LI>
    <LI> Explain the distinction between extensive thermodynamic variables and intensive thermodynamic variables</LI>
    <LI> Which of the variables you wrote in answer to the first question are intensive and which are extensive.</LI>
    <LI> Explain how the word phase is used in thermodynamics.  What do we use this word to mean?</LI>
    <LI> How do the extensive thermodynamic variables behave in a system at equilibrium?</LI>
    <LI> What can you state about the values of the intensive thermodynamic variables for two phases that are in contact and at equilibrium?</LI>

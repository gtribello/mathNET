TITLE: Variance 

DESCRIPTION:

The variance, $\textrm{var}(X)$, of a random variable, $X$, can be calculated from the expectations of the random variables, $\mathbb{E}(X)$,
and the expectation of $g(x)=x^2$ - $\mathbb{E}(X^2)$ by using the following formula:
$$
\textrm{var}(X) = \mathbb{E}(X^2) - [\mathbb{E}(X)]^2
$$
This quantity can also be calculated as:
$$
\textrm{var}(X) = \mathbb{E}[ (X - \mathbb{E}(X))^2 ]
$$

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to write out the definition of the variance of a random variable.
- You should be able to derive expressions for the variance of bernoulli, binomial, geometric, poisson, uniform, exponential and normal random variables.

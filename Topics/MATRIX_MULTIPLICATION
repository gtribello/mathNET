TITLE: Matrix multiplication

DESCRIPTION:

The $ij$ element of the product of two matrices $A$ and $B$ is calculated using:
$$
(A B)_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^N A_{ik}B_{kj}
$$
where $N$ is the number of columns in the matrix $A$ and the number of rows in matrix $B$.

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to write out an expression for the elements of a product of two matrices using summation notation.
- You should be able to calculate products of matrices with (at most) 5 rows or columns using pen and paper. 
- You should be able to write a program in python that uses nested for loops to calculate the product of two matrices.

TITLE: Thermodynamic Potentials

DESCRIPTION:

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to give the definitions for the enthalpy, helmholtz free energy, gibbs free energy and grand potential.
- You should be able to derive expressions for infinitessimal changes in the enthalpy, helmholtz free energy, gibbs free energy and grand potential.
- You should be able to to explain what requirements are placed on the change in Helmholtz free energy for spontaneous processes in a closed system with constant volume and constant temperature. You should also be able to explain what requirements are placed on the change in Gibbs free energy for a spontaneous processes in a closed system with constant pressure and constant temperature.

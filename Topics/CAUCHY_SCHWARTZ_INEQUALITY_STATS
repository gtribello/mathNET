TITLE: The Cauchy Schwartz Inequality in Statistics

DESCRIPTION:

In statistics the Cauchy Schwartz Inequality states that:

$$
[\mathbb{E}(XY) ]^2 \le \mathbb{E}(X^2)\mathbb{E}(Y^2)
$$

where $X$ and $Y$ are two random variables.  This is a particular
manifestation of a deeper theorem of the same name.

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to derive the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality that appears in statistics.
- You should be able to show that the correlation coefficient for two random variables must be between -1 and +1 by making use of the Cauchy Schwartz theorem.

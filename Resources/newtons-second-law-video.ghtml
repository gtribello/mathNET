QUESTIONS:

- What does Newton's second law state?
- Give a formula that allows one to calculate the derivative $\frac{\textrm{d}f}{\textrm{d}x}$ of the function $f(x)$ as a limit.
- By solving the limit that you wrote down in answer to the previous question show that the derivative of the function $f(x)=x^3$ is equal to $3x^2$.

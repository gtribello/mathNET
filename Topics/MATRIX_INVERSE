TITLE: The matrix inverse

DESCRIPTION:

The inverse of a square matrix $\mathbf{A}$ (if it exists) is the matrix $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ which satisfies:
$$
\mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^{-1}=\mathbf{I}
$$
where $\mathbf{I}$ is the unit matrix:
$$
\mathbf{I} = 
\left(
\begin{matrix}
1 &  0  & \cdots  &    0 \\
0  & 1  &  \cdots  &   0  \\
\vdots  &  \vdots   & \ddots &  \vdots \\
0 & 0 &  \cdots &  1  \\
\end{matrix}
\right)
$$

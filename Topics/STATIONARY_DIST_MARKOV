TITLE: Ergodic Markov chains

DESCRIPTION:

A Markov chain is said to be ergodic if it has a limiting stationary distribution.
This limiting stationary distribution tells one the probability that you will be in 
each of the states of the Markov chain.  Hence, for an ergodic Markov chain with $n$ states
the stationary distribution is an $n$-dimensional vector of probabilities.  

The stationary distribution of a Markov chain can be found by finding the top (left) eigenvector of 
the one-step transition probability matrix using Gaussian elimination.  In addition, the elements of 
this matrix satisfy the ergodic theorem:
$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{M_i(n)}{n} = \frac{1}{\mathbb{E}(T_i)}
$$
where $M_i$ is the number of visits to state $i$ if there have been $n$ steps in your Markov chain and $\mathbb{E}(T_i)$
is the expectation of the return time to state $i$.

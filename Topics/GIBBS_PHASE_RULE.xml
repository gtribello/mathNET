  <TITLE> Gibbs Phase rule </TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>


The requirement that all intensive variables must be homogenous (equal) across the entirety of the system when the system is at equilibrium ensures that <b> at equilibrium</b> not all thermodynamic quantities are independent.  In particular, there is a result called Gibb's phase rule which states:

$$

F = C - \pi + 2

$$

Here $C$ is the number of components in the system (i.e. the number of chemically distinct species), $\pi$ is the number of phases in the system (i.e. the number of distinct regions of space in the system where the properties of the material are essentially uniform) and $F$ is the number of thermodynamic variables that are independent.

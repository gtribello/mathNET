  <DESCRIPTION>


The central equation in the theory of continuous time Markov chains is the Kolmogorov equation:

$$

\frac{\textrm{d} \mathbf{P}(t)}{\textrm{d}t} = \mathbf{P(t)}\mathbf{Q}

$$

In this equation $\mathbf{Q}$ is the so called jump rate matrix, which is the following matrix of limits.

$$

\lim_{\delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{P(\delta t) - \mathbf{I}}{\delta t}

$$

The first of these two equations has the differential of a matrix of probabilities on the left hand side.  

A continuous time Markov chain thus has a limiting stationary distribution $\pi$ if there is any non-zero 

vector that satisfies:

$$

\pi \mathbf{Q} = 0

$$

This equation comes about by setting $\frac{\textrm{d} \mathbf{P}(t)}{\textrm{d}t}=0$ in the first equation.

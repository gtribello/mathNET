  <TITLE> Limit of a function </TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>


In mathematics a limit of a function is the value the function approaches as the input approaches some value.  Limits are essential to calculus and are used to define continuity, derivatives and integrals.  In formulas, a limit is usually written as:

$$

\lim_{n \rightarrow c} f(n) = L

$$

which is read as "in the limit as $n$ approaches $c$ the function $f(n)$ equals $L$."



Limits often appear when you have functions that are quotients:

$$

f(x) = \frac{g(x)}{h(x)}

$$

the reason being that if there can be values of $x$ for which the function in the numerator, $g(x)$, and the function in the denominator, $h(x)$, both equal either $0$ or $\infty$.  The values of $\frac{0}{0}$ and $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$ are both undefined.

TITLE: Theory of exact differentials

DESCRIPTION:

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to test differentials of the form $\textrm{d}u = C_1(x,y) \textrm{d}x + C_2(x,y) \textrm{d}y$ for exactness.
- You should be able to find the function $u(x,y)$ from a differential of the form $\textrm{d}u = C_1(x,y) \textrm{d}x + C_2(x,y) \textrm{d}y$

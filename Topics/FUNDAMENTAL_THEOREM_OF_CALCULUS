TITLE: Fundamental theorem of calculus

DESCRIPTION:

If $f(x)$ is the derivative of the function 
$F(x)$ i.e.
$$
f(x) = {dF(x) \over dx} 
$$
then:
$$
F(b)-F(a)=\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \ dx  
$$
Furthermore, for any constant, $a$:
$$
   {d \over dx} \int_{a}^{x} f(t) dt = f(x)  \quad .
$$

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to write out the fundamental theorem of calculus
- You should be able to find the definite and indefinite integration of $x^n$ and $e^{\lambda x}$.

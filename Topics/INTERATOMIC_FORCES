TITLE: Interatomic forces

DESCRIPTION:

We can describe the interatomic forces that act between pairs of atoms using a potential.  More accurate methods for calculating
these forces involving solving the Schrodinger equation and using the tools of quantum mechanics.  This is computationally expensive, 
however, and so we oftentimes we use more approximate classical models.  These potentials include terms to describe the covalent bonds
between molecules (intra-molecular terms) and other terms to include the various kinds of inter-molecular forces that act between pairs
of atoms.  These inter-molecular terms are often broken down into three components: the electrostic interaction between charges, the 
short range repulstion that occurs when the electron clouds around atoms begin to overlap and the dispersion interaction.  

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to explain the distinction between inter and intramolecular forces in classical potentials.
- You should be able to explain the physical origin for intermolecular interactions and give mathematical expressions that are often employed to model the potential due to these kinds of interactions.
- You should be able to explain the physical origin for the electrostiatic interaction and give an expression for the potential due to this interaction.
- You should be able to explain the physical origin for the short-repulsion and give some examples of the classical terms that we use to model the potential due to this interaction.
- You should be able to explain the physical origin for the dispersion interaction between atoms and give an expression that can be used to model the effect of this interaction.

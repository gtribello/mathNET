  <TITLE>Solving limits using the squeeze method
</TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>
In mathematics a limit of a function is the value the function approaches as the input approaches some value.  Generally these limits cannot
be calculated using our usual approach of sticking numbers into the formula and as such we must find other approaches for determining these
quantities.  In this exercise you will learn about one approach - squeezing inequalities - that can be used to solve limits.

    <EXAMPLE>
      <QUESTION>
Find value of the following limit:
$$
\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\sin(x)}{x}
$$
</QUESTION>
      <SOLUTION>
If we put the equation in the question into words we are being asked to ``find the limit of $\sin(x)$ over $x$ as $x$ tends to infinity.'' 
In more prosaic terms substitute $\infty$ into the equation after the limit sign and see what happens. Obviously, this is not a problem 
we can solve with a calculator as (a) we cannot put infinity into a calculator and (b) even if we could the value of 
$\frac{\infty}{\infty}$ is undefined. We thus have to use some other scheme.  For this particular problem we solve the limit as follows:
We know that:
$$
-1 \le \sin(x) \le +1 
$$
and therefore that:
$$
-\frac{1}{x} \le \sin(x) \le + \frac{1}{x}
$$
If we now take limits we have:
$$
\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} -\frac{1}{x} \le \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \sin(x) \le + \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{x}
$$
We next note that as $x \rightarrow \infty \quad \frac{1}{x} \rightarrow 0$.  This implies that:
$$
0 \le \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \sin(x) \le 0
$$
Zero is the only number that satisifes both these inequality so:
$$
\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \sin(x) = 0
$$

TITLE: Variable separable differential equations

DESCRIPTION:

A differential equation is said to be separable if the variables can be separated.  That is, a 
separable equation is one that can be written in the form:
$$
\textrm{d}f = G(x) \textrm{d}x
$$

The general solution to these types of differential equations are:

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to recognize when a differential equation can be solved by separation of variables.
- You should be able to use the method of separation of variables to solve differential equations.

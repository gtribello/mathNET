TITLE: The grand canonical ensemble

DESCRIPTION:

The grand canonical ensemble is a statistical model that can be used to describe the behavior of a system
with a constant temperature, a constant chemical potential and a constant volume/pressure.  (In what follows
we will enforce constant a volume.)  If we have a Hamiltonian, $H(x,p)$, for the system the isothermal-isobaric 
partition function can be calculated using:
$$
Z_{gc} = \sum_i e^{-\beta H(x_i,p_i) } e^{\beta \mu N(x_i,p_i) }
$$
The sum here runs over all the microstates in the system and is replaced by an integral if you have a continuous
rather than a discrete state space.  $\beta$, meanwhile, is equal to one divided by the temperature, $T$, multiplied by
Boltzmann's constant, $k_B$.  That is to say $\beta = \frac{1}{k_B T}$.

The probabibility of being with an individual microstate in the grand canonical ensemble is given by:
$$
p_i = \frac{ e^{-\beta H(x_i,p_i)} e^{\beta \mu N(x_i,p_i) } }{ Z_i }
$$
We can thus calculate the average number of atoms in the system by computing an emsemble average using:
$$
\langle N \rangle = \sum_i N(x_i,p_i) p_i
$$
or by using the analytical result below:
$$
\langle N \rangle = \frac{ \partial \ln Z_{gc} }{\partial (\beta \mu) }
$$
There is a similar result that relates the second derivative of the logarithm of the partition function with the fluctuations
in the number of atoms:
$$
\langle (N - \langle N \rangle)^2 \rangle = \left(  \frac{\partial^2 \ln Z_{gc}(\mu,V,T)}{\partial (\beta \mu)^2} \right)
$$

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to write an expression for the grand canonical partition function.
- You should be able to write an expression for the probability of being in a particular micostate if the system has constant chemical potnetial, constant volume/pressure and constant temperature.
- You should be able to explain how the grand potential and the grand canonical partition function are related.
- You should be able to explain how ensemble averages are calculated in the grand canonical ensemble
- You should be able to explain how we can calculate the ensemble average of the number of atoms by taking a derivative of the grand canonical partition function.
- You should be able to explain why the second derivative of the partition function must be positive using considerations based on fluctuations.

TITLE: The M/M/1 Queue 

DESCRIPTION:

The M/M/1 Queue is the simplest stochastic process that can be used to model a queue.  
In this model the arrival of customers in the Queue is modelled using a Poisson process 
and the length of time each person takes to be served is modelled using an exponential 
random variable.  The jump rate matrix for an M/M/1 queue with infinite capacity is thus:
$$
Q = \left(
\begin{matrix}
-\lambda & \lambda & 0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 \\
\mu & -\lambda-\mu & \lambda & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & \mu & -\lambda-\mu & \lambda & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 \\ 
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots 
\end{matrix}
\right)
$$
while the jump rate matrix for an M/M/1 queue with finite capacity is:
$$
Q = \left(
\begin{matrix}
-\lambda & \lambda & 0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 \\
\mu & -\lambda-\mu & \lambda & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & \mu & -\lambda-\mu & \lambda & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 \\ 
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & -\mu & \mu 
\end{matrix}
$$
Both these processes have a limiting stationary distribution when $\frac{\lambda}{\mu}<1$.  
This stationary distribution is only valid when the average rate at which people arrive in the queue
$\lambda$ is less the average time it takes to serve a customer $\frac{1}{\lambda}$.  The elements of
this stationary distribution, $\pi_k$, tell us the probability that there will be $k$ people in the queue
at any given time.  For the infinite capacity case these probabilities are:
$$
\pi_k = \left( 1 - \frac{\lambda}{\mu} \right) \left(\frac{\lambda}{\mu} \right)^k
$$
while in the finite capacity case these probabilities are:
$$
\pi_k = \frac{\left( 1 - \frac{\lambda}{\mu} \right) \left(\frac{\lambda}{\mu} \right)^k}{ 1 - \frac{\lambda}{\mu} \right)^{N+1} }
$$
where in this second expression $N$ is the maximum capacity of the queue.

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to write out transition graphs for an M/M/1 queue with finite capacity and an M/M/1 queue with infinite capacity.
- You should be able to write out jump rate matrices for an M/M/1 queue with finite capacity and an M/M/1 queue with infinite capacity.
- You should be able to explain what conditions must be satisfied for an M/M/1 queue to have a limiting stationary distribution and what the limiting behavior of the system is when these conditions are not satisfied.
- You should be able to derive an expression for the stationary distribution for a MM1 Queue with infinite capacity and for an MM1 Queue with finite capacity.

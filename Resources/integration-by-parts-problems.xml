  <DESCRIPTION>
Remember when solving the following problem that the method of integration by parts is derived by integrating the product
rule rule and rearranging the resulting expression.  We thus have:
$$
\int u \frac{\textrm{d}v}{\textrm{d}x} \textrm{d}x = uv - \int v \frac{\textrm{d}u}{\textrm{d}x} \textrm{d}x
$$
When using this method remember that you must divide the function you wish to integrate into a part $u$ and a 
part $\frac{\textrm{d}v}{\textrm{d}x}$.  You then differentiate $u$ and integrate $\frac{\textrm{d}v}{\textrm{d}x}$
and insert what emerges into the equations above.  Generally, when you pick the functions to use for $u$ and 
$\frac{\textrm{d}v}{\textrm{d}x}$ you want to choose functions so that $v \frac{\textrm{d}u}{\textrm{d}x} \textrm{d}x$
is a simpler function to integrate than the original $u \frac{\textrm{d}v}{\textrm{d}x} \textrm{d}x$.

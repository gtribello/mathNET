TITLE: Integration by parts

DESCRIPTION:

Integration by parts involves using the product rule in reverse.  In essence you recognise the following equality 
when you apply the fundamental theorem of calculus to the product rule:

$$
\int u {dv \over dx} dx = uv - \int v {du \over dx} . dx  \quad .
$$

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to solve definite and indefinite integrals using integration by parts.
- You should be able to solve more complex integrals by using integration by parts multiple times.
- You should be able to solve more complex definite and indefinite integrals using a combination of integration by substitution and integration by parts.

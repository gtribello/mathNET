  <TITLE> Taking positive integer powers of a square matrix </TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>


We can calculate the second power of a square matrix, $\mathbf{A}$, by multiplying it by itself:

$$

(A^2)_{ij} = \sum_k A_{ik} A_{kj}

$$

If we thus multiply the square of the matrix, $\mathbf{A}^2$, by $\mathbf{A}$ we get the cube of a matrix.

We thus arrive at the following general rule:

$$

\mathbf{A}^{n+m} = \mathbf{A}^n \mathbf{A}^m \qquad \forall n,m > 0

$$

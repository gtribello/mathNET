  <DESCRIPTION>


We can describe the interatomic forces that act between pairs of atoms using a potential.  More accurate methods for calculating

these forces involving solving the Schrodinger equation and using the tools of quantum mechanics.  This is computationally expensive, 

however, and so we oftentimes we use more approximate classical models.  These potentials include terms to describe the covalent bonds

between molecules (intra-molecular terms) and other terms to include the various kinds of inter-molecular forces that act between pairs

of atoms.  These inter-molecular terms are often broken down into three components: the electrostic interaction between charges, the 

short range repulstion that occurs when the electron clouds around atoms begin to overlap and the dispersion interaction.

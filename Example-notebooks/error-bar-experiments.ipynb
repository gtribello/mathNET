    "<b> Use this section to discuss any theory that is relevant to the subject of your report. This theory should have been discovered when you performed your research.  Break your theory section into suitable subsections as I have done below.  </b> \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's suppose that we generate $N$ identical and independent random variables.  If we call each of these random variables $X_i$ we can calculate the sample mean, $\\mu$, using:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N X_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "As this quantity $\\mu$ is calculated by summing a set of $N$ random variables it is itself random.  There is thus an associated cumulative probability distribution function for this random quantity.  More importantly, however, if we were to generate a second different set of $N$ identical and independent random variables the value that we would get for $\\mu$ from this second set of experiments would not equal the value that we got from our first set of experiments. In statistics, we thus often choose, when we quote sample means, to quote the value the estimate of the sample mean that we got from our experiment together with a range of values that our estimate of the would fall into in 90% of any repeat experiments that we might perform in the future.  This range is referred to as the error bar on our estimate of the sample mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods based on the central limit theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "From the central limit theorem we know if we calculate the sample mean from sufficiently large number of independent and identical random variables with finite expectation and variance the cumulative probabiltiy distribution function for the distribution of the sample mean is a Gaussian with a mean and variance that we know.  In estimating the error bars we thus will often choose to therefore assume that our estimate of the sample mean represents a sample from a normal distribution.  Furthermore, as we have an analytic expression for the cumulative probability distribution function for this variable we can derive the following expression that relates the degree of confidence we have in our estimate, $p_c$, to a particular range of values around the mean, $\\epsilon$, and the number of experiments, $N$, that  we performed:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_c = 2 \\Phi\\left( \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{N}} \\right) - 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Rearranging this expression we arrive at the following expression for the range, $\\epsilon$, around our sample mean that the true expectation has a probability of $p_c$ of being in.  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\epsilon = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}} \\Phi^{-1}\\left( \\frac{p_c + 1}{2} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "To use this expression, however, we have to have an estimate of the variance, $\\sigma^2$ for our random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods based on bootstrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use bootstrapping to estimate an error bar instead of using the technique described in the previous short section.  The advantage of this technique is that we do not need to make any assumption about the distribution of the parameter that we are trying to fit.  In other words, we do not have to assume that our estimate of the sample mean represents a sample from a normal random variable.  We can thus use bootstrapping even when the sample size is relatively small and the central limit theorem does not hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The essence of the bootstrapping technique is a recognition that by calculating the parameter/s of the random variable we have fitted the probability distribution function for that random variable.  We can thus build samples from the fitted random variable and investigate the properties of the distribution of fitted parameters that we obtain.  To build a bootstrap estimate of the error bar for a Bernoulli random variable we would thus proceed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculate the sample mean $\\mu^*$ from our sample of $N$ bernoulli random variables.\n",
    "- Generate $K$ sets of $N$ bernoulli random variables from a Bernoulli distribution with parameter $\\mu^*$.\n",
    "- Calculate the sample mean for each of the $K$ sets of $N$ bernoulli random variables that were generated in step 2.\n",
    "- Sort the estimates of the sample mean that we got from the previous step.  If we have 200 bootstrap samples we can use the value of the 5th lowest of these estimates, $\\mu_5$, and the 195th lowest, $\\mu_{195}$ to estimate the 95% confidence limits as $2\\mu^* - \\mu_5$ and $2\\mu^* - \\mu_{95}$, where $\\mu^*$ is our original estimate for the parameter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, what we are doing when we use the bootstrapping technique is we are building a set of samples for what value our estimate might have taken if the true value of our sample mean was equal to the estimate that we obtained from our sample.  In other words, we are building a model for the distribution of the sample mean by sampling and extracting our confidence limits from the information we have on the distribtion.\n",

In this final method of bootstrapping we make no such assumption.  Instead, what we do is we assume that our esimate of the $p$ parameter is the correct one.  We then take multiple sets of $N$ samples from a Bernoulli random variable with this parameter and estimate a sample mean from each of these sets of random variables.  By repeating this procedure multiple times we can construct a probability distribution for the parameter $p$.  This is what is done in the cell below.

For instance, I can extract the 95 % confidence limits by sorting my sample and by taking the 5th and 195th element of my sorted list of parameter values.  Obviously, the justification for doing this is that 95% of my samples fall within this particular range.  In the cell below I do just this for the data that I have just generated."

    "The data that I generated to demonstrate the bootstrap technique are samples from a Bernoulli random variable.  Obviously, different methods are required if the random variable sampled is not a Bernoulli random variable.  In addition, to use the statistical bootstrap to estimate confidence you really need access to a computer.  The method based on the central limit theorem is thus useful in order to get an estimate of the error bars.  "

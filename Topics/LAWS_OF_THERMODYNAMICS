TITLE: The first and second laws of thermodynamics

DESCRIPTION:

<p>
<b> The first law of thermodynamics </b> states:
\[
\textrm{d}E = \textrm{d}q + \textrm{d}w 
\]
In other words we measure the change in internal energy by adding together the work done one the system and the heat absorbed by the system.  We assume that the internal energy is an exact differential.  This has three important consequences:
<ul>
<li> The change in internal energy on moving from equilibrium state A to state B does not depend on the path taken. </li>
<li> The change in internal energy on moving around a closed path that starts and ends in equilibrium state A is zero. </li>
<li> The internal energy of an isolated system is constant.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b> The second law of thermodynamics </b> states:
\[
\Delta_{A\rightarrow B} S \ge \int_A^B \frac{\textrm{d}q}{T}
\]
The equality sign holds when the transition is reversible, the inequality holds when the transition is irreversible.  The entropy is once again an exact differential so:
<ul>
<li> The change in entropy on moving from equilibrium state A to state B does not depend on the path taken. </li>
<li> The change in entropy on moving around a closed path that starts and ends in equilibrium state A is zero. </li>
</ul>
Importantly, however, because of the inequality sign in the second law of thermodynamics, the heat absorbed during a transition will depend on the path taken and during moves around closed paths heat will be input/output from the system.  The consequence of this is that it is impossible to build an engine that converts 100% all of the heat it absorbs into work.
</p>

<p>
<b> By combining the laws of thermodynamics </b> we can arrive at:
\[
\textrm{d}E = T\textrm{d}S - P\textrm{d}V + \mu \textrm{d}N
\]
where $E$ is the internal energy, $T$ is temperature, $S$ is entropy, $P$ is pressure, $V$ is volume, $\mu$ is the chemical potential and $N$ is the number of atoms.

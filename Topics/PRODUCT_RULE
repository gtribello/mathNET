TITLE: Product Rule

DESCRIPTION:

The derivative of a product of functions, $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$, with respect to $x$ is given by the product rule:
$$
\frac{\textrm{d}f(x)}{\textrm{d}x} = h(x)\frac{\textrm{d}g(x)}{\textrm x} g(x)\frac{\textrm{d}h(x)}{\textrm{x}}
$$

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to write out the product rule.
- You should be able to use the product rule to calculate the derivative of products of functions.
- You should be able to use the product rule in tandem with the chain rule to find derivatives for particularly complicated functions.

    <LI> BEFORE WATCHING THE VIDEO: Write out the definition of the derivative as a limit</LI>
    <LI> BEFORE WATCHING THE VIDEO: Write out the McLaurin expansion for the exponential function</LI>
    <LI> Explain in your own words how continuous time Markov chains differ from the Markov chains that we have been studying thus far in this course.</LI>
    <LI> How do we take a limit of a matrix of functions and how then do we differentiate a matrix of functions</LI>
    <LI> Explain why the following matrix of limits cannot be calculated using the method you have just described $\lim_{\delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{P(t+\delta t) - P(t)}{\delta t}$</LI>
    <LI> How is the Jump rate matrix for a continuous time Markov chain, $\mathbf{Q}$, defined?</LI>
    <LI> Explain how the exponential of a matrix is calculated.  Hint: You do not take the exponential of each of the elements in turn.</LI>
    <LI> Show by substitution that $\mathbf{P}(t) = \exp(\mathbf{Q}t)$ is a solution of the Kolmogorov equation.</LI>
    <LI> How do you determine whether or not a continuous time Markov chain has a limiting stationary distribution and how do you determine the elements of this distribution</LI>

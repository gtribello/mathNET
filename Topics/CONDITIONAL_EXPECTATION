TITLE: Conditional expectation

DESCRIPTION:

The conditional expectation of a discrete random variable $X$ given that the random variable $Y$ equals $y_i$ is given by:

$$
\mathbb{E}(X|Y=y_i) = \sum_{j=0}^\infty x_j P(X=x_j | Y=y_i )
$$

Conditional expectation values are useful because we can use them to calculate absolute expectation values using the conditional 
expectation theorem:

$$
\mathbb{E}(X) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty \mathbb{E}(X|Y=y_i) P(Y=y_i)
$$

Another useful result that is derived using similar logic involves the fact that the expectation $\mathbb{E}(XY)$ can be calculated as:

$$
\mathbb{E}(XY) = \mathbb{E}(X)\mathbb{E}(Y)
$$

If the random variables $X$ and $Y$ are independent.  This equation does not hold in general when the variables are not independent.

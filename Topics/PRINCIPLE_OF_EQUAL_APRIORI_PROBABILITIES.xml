  <TITLE> The principle of equal apriori probabilities </TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>


Any physical system can adopt one of a number of microstates.  For a quantum system these are the various quantum levels.  For a classical system these are the various combinations of velocity and positions of the atoms in the system.  Regardless, the set of all the possible microstates the system can adopt is known as <b>phase space</b>.  The principle of equal a priori probabilities assumes that any system in equilibrium is equally likely to be in any one of the accessible microstates.  Consequently, to determine the probability of being in any microstate one has to minimise the information contained in the distribution.  However, to make the analogy with classical thermodynamics clearer we will maximise minus the information, which we will assert is equal to the entropy:

\[

S = -k_B \sum_{i} p_i \ln p_i 

\]

The sum here runs over the set of all microstates.

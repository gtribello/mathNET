TITLE: Response functions

DESCRIPTION:

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to explain the constraints on the first and second derivatives of the internal energy, enthalpy, Helmholtz free energy and Gibbs free energy at equilibrium and explain how these place constraints on the response functions.

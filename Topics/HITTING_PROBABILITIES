TITLE: Hitting time and hitting probability

DESCRIPTION:

If a Markov chain has a combination of recurrent and transient states it has no limiting stationary distribution.  The limiting behavior of
these chains is to move away from the transient states and in to one or a subset of the recurrent states.  If states are absorbing (or parts of the 
chain are absorbing) we can calculate the probability that we will finish in each of the absorbing parts using:
$$
\mathbf{H} = ( \mathbf{I} - \mathbf{Q} )^{-1} \mathbf{R}
$$
where here $\mathbf{H}$ is a matrix known as the hitting probability matrix, $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix, $\mathbf{Q}$ is the part of the 1-step transition probability 
matrix that concerns transition between transient states and $\mathbf{R}$ is the part of the transition matrix that tells you about transitions between transient and 
recurrent states.  

The time it takes to move out of the transient states and into an absorbing part of the Markov chain is a random variable.  We can calculate this by computing
the hitting times using:
$$
\mathbf{h} = ( \mathbf{I} - \mathbf{Q} )^{-1} \mathbf{1}
$$
Here $\mathbf{1}$ is a column vector containing all ones.

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to calculate hitting times and hitting probabilities for Markov chains that have at most three transient and three absorbing (recurrent) states using pen and paper.
- You should be able to write computer programs that will calculate hitting times and hitting probabilities for larger matrices.

    <LI> Explain the meaning of the word ergodic in the context of Markov chains.</LI>
    <LI> Why can't an ergodic Markov chain have transient states?</LI>
    <LI> Give a statement of the ergodic theorem ensuring that you define all the terms in the equation.</LI>
    <LI> Explain how you can calculate the expected return time to a state if you are given the stationary distribution.</LI>
    <LI> Explain what is meant by the period of a state in the context of Markov chains.</LI>
    <LI> What is the greatest common divisor for the following sets of numbers $\{2,4,6,8\}$, $\{4,8,12\}$, $\{4,5,8,12\}$ and $\{4,8,12,14\}$</LI>
    <LI> Draw the transition graph for a Markov chain involving 5 states in which every state has a period of 5 and a transition graph for a 5 state Markov chain in which every state has a period of 3.</LI>

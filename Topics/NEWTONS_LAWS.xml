  <TITLE> Newtons Laws of Motion </TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>


Newton's three laws of motion are the bedrock upon which classical mechanics is built.

These three laws state:



<ul>

<li> A body remains at rest or travelling at a constant speed unless acted upon by an external force. </li>

<li> The force acting on a body is equal to the rate of change of the bodies momentum </li>

<li> Every action has an equal and opposite reaction </li>

</ul>

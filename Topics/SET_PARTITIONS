TITLE: Partition (set theory)

DESCRIPTION:

If we have a set $\Omega$ a partition, $\{ A_k \}$, of $\Omega$ is a set 
of $n$ subsets of $\Omega$ that have the following properties:

$$
 A_j \cap A_j = \emptyset \quad \forall \quad i \ne j \qquad \textrm{and} \qquad \bigcup_{j=1}^n A_j = \Omega
$$

Here $\emptyset$ is the empty set $\cap$ denotes the intersection of two sets and $\bigcup$ denotes the union of the $n$ sets in the partition. 

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to explain the properties of a partition of a set.
- You should be able to draw a Venn diagram illustrating a partition of a set.
- You should be able to explain how partitions of the sample space are used in the construction of random variables in statistics.

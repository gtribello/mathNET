TITLE: The Chapman Kolmogorov Relation

DESCRIPTION:

The Chapman Kolmogorov relation is an important result in the theory of (discrete) Markov chains as
it provides a method for calculating the $n$-step transition probability matrix 
of a Markov chain from the 1-step transition probability matrix of a Markov chain.  The Chapman-Kolmogorov
relation can be written as follows:
$$
\mathbf{P}^{n+m} = \mathbf{P}^n\mathbf{P}^m
$$
Here $\mathbf{P}^{n+m}$ is the $n+m$-step transition probability matrix, $\mathbf{P}^{n}$ is the $n$-step transition probability matrix
and $\mathbf{P}^{m}$ is the $m$-step transition probability matrix.

The above equation holds for discrete Markov chains.  For continuous time Markov chains the elements of the transition probability matrix
are written as a function of time.  For continuous time Markov chains the Chapman Komogorov relation is written as:
$$
\mathbf{P}(t + s ) = \mathbf{P}(t)\mathbf{P}(s)
$$

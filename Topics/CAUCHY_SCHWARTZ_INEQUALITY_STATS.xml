  <TITLE> The Cauchy Schwartz Inequality in Statistics </TITLE>
  <DESCRIPTION>


In statistics the Cauchy Schwartz Inequality states that:



$$

[\mathbb{E}(XY) ]^2 \le \mathbb{E}(X^2)\mathbb{E}(Y^2)

$$



where $X$ and $Y$ are two random variables.  This is a particular

manifestation of a deeper theorem of the same name.

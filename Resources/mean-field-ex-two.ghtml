TITLE: The free energy landscape for the mean field 1D ising model

GEOGEBRA: https://www.geogebra.org/material/iframe/id/SmTueeSA/width/1920/height/860/border/888888

DESCRIPTION:

The green line shows the free energy, $F$, expressed as a function of the average magnetization, $\langle M \rangle$, for 
a mean field description of the 1D Ising model in the thermodynamic limit.  The black line is the first derivative of this 
free energy with respect to the
magnetization, $\langle M \rangle$.  There are two sliders the first allows you to control the strength of the magnetic field, 
$H$, which is expressed in units of the interaction constant for the spins, $J$.  The second slider allows you to control the 
inverse temperature, $\beta$,  which is expressed in units of $\frac{J}{k_B T}$

QUESTIONS:

- What is significant about the points where the black curve intercepts with the $x$ axis?
- When the applied field $H$ is equal to 0 at how many points does the black line intercept with the $x$ axis?  What happens as the the inverse temperature is increased?
- Describe the shape of the green curve when $H=0$ and when (a) $T \lt 0.5$ and when (b) $T \gt 0.5$.  How does the shape of this curve differ in these two regimes?  What happens to the derivative of the free energy with respect to $\langle M \rangle$ at $H=0$ when $T=0.5$?
- What happens to the shape of the green curve when $H \ne 0$.  Comment on the behavior of the turning points and the way this number changes with field strength and temperature.
- Given what you have discussed explain how the magnetization behaves as you move from the $T \gt 0.5$ regime to the $T \lt 0.5$ regime in the absense of an applied field 
- How does the magnetisation behave as the temperature is increased in the presence of an applied magentic field?

TITLE: Independent random variables

DESCRIPTION:

Two random variables are said to be independent if:
$$
P(X=x|Y=y) = P(X=x) \qquad \forall \quad i,j
$$
If two random variables are indpendent (<b> and only if they are independent</b>) the joint probability mass function, $f_{XY}(x,y)$ can be calculated 
from the marginals, $f_X(x)$ and $f_Y(y)$, using:
$$
f_{XY}(x,y) = f_X(x)f_Y(y)
$$

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to explain in terms of conditional probability what it means for events to be independent.
- You should be able to calculate the joint probability mass function, $f_{XY}(x,y)$ for a pair of independent variables, $X$ and $Y$, from the two individual marginal probability mass functions, $f_X(x)$ and $f_Y(y)$.

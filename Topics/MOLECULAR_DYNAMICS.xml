  <DESCRIPTION>


Molecular dynamics is a computer simulation method for studying the physical movements 

of atoms and molecules.  In this method the forces between atoms are computed so that the 

positions and velocities of the atoms can be updated using Newton's Laws of motion, which are

solved numerically.

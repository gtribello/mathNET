TITLE: The law of large numbers

DESCRIPTION:

The law of large numbers states that for a set of independent and 
identically distributed random variables, $X_1$, $X_2$, $\dots$ the following 
holds:

\begin{equation}
 \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} P\left( \left| \frac{S_n}{n} - \mathbb{E}(X) \right| >
\epsilon \right) = 0
\nonumber
\end{equation}

\noindent where $n$ is the number of random variables, $S_n = X_1 + X_2 + \dots$ and $\epsilon$
is a small number.

\noindent This expression cannot be used if your random variable has $\mathbb{E}(X) = \infty$

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to write down the law of large numbers without the proof.
- You should be able to explain why the the expectation of random variables are useful by making reference to the law of large numbers.
- You should be able to explain the random variables for which the law of large numbers does not hold.

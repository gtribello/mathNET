TITLE: Maxwell relations

DESCRIPTION:

The Maxwell relations are a set of equations in thermodynamics which are derivable from the symmetry of 
second derivatives and from the definitions of the thermodynamic potentials. 

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to derive Maxwell relations starting from all the thermodynamic potentials.

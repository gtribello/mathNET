TITLE: l'Hopital's Rule

DESCRIPTION:

l'Hopital's rule is a way of solving limits for functions of the form:
$$
lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}
$$
l'Hopital's rule is derived by performing a Taylor series expansion of the functions in the numerator and denominator 
($f(x)$ and $g(x)$ in the example above) around the limit (around $a$ for the above example).  The $f(a)$ and $g(a)$
terms in these expansions will be zero (this, after all, is why we are solving the limit in the first place.  You then
consider only the leading terms in the expansion and thus arrive at l'Hopital's Rule:
$$
lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}
$$

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to write down l'Hoptial's rule.
- You should be able to solve limits by applying l'Hopital's rule.
- You should know what to do to solve the limit $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ when $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ are both equal to zero.

    <LI> Explain what the elements of the probability mass function for a discrete random variable represent.</LI>
    <LI> Write out the law of large numbers and explain what this this theorem tells us about the sum of a large number of random variables</LI>
    <LI> What is the probability mass function for the auxiliary random variables that we introduce when we calculating the histogram.</LI>
    <LI> What is the expectation equal to for the auxiliary random variables that we introduce when we calculate the histogram. </LI>
    <LI> By making reference to the law of large numbers explain why the histogram converges onto a single function when a large number of experiments are performed. </LI>

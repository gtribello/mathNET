    <LI> What is the conjugate variable to volume?  Is volume an intensive thermodynamic variable or extensive thermodynamic variable?  What about its conjugate variable is it intensive?</LI>
    <LI> Is temperature an extensive or intensive variable?  What thermodynamic variable is conjugate to temperature?</LI>
    <LI> Is the number of atoms in a phase an intensive or extensive thermodynamic variable.  What thermodynamic variable is conjugate to number of atoms</LI>

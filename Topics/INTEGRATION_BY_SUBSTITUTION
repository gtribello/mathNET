TITLE: Integration by substitution

DESCRIPTION:

Integration by substitution involves using the chain rule in reverse.  Lets suppose you wish to 
calculate the definite integral:
$$
\int_a^b f(u) . du
$$
In integration by substitution the variable $u$ is written as a function of some other variable, $x$.
We thus rewrite the integral above as:
$$
\int_a^b f(u) . du = \int_{u^{-1}(a)}^{u^{-1}(b)} f[u(x)] {du \over dx} . dx
$$   
where $u^{-1}(x)$ is the inverse function of $u(x)$.  Notice that in applying this technique you must change
three things:

<ul>
<li> You must change the integrand by making the substitution.  In the above example you must write the original integrand, which was in terms of $u$, in terms of $x$. </li>
<li> You must change the infinitessimal.  In the above example you change the $du$ into ${du \over dx} . dx$. </li>
<li> You must change the limits if you are solving a definite integral. </li> 
</ul>

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to solve definite and indefinite integrals using integration by substitution.
- You should be able to solve more complex definite and indefinite integrals using a combination of integration by substitution and integration by parts.

TITLE: Introduction to matrices

DESCRIPTION:

An $m \times n$ matrix, $\mathbf{A}$,  is a rectangular array of numbers like
this:
$$
A = 
\left(
\begin{matrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots  &   a_{1n} \\
a_{21} &      &    \cdots  & a_{2n}  \\
\vdots  &  \vdots   &   &  \vdots \\
a_{m1} & a_{m2} &  \cdots & a_{mn} \\
\end{matrix}
\right)
$$

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- When given a matrix you should be able to determine the number of rows and columns it has.
- You should be able to explain what it means when we say that a matrix is square.
- When given a matrix you should be able to find the value of element $(i,j)$.
- You should be able to write python programs involving matrices using numpy arrays.

TITLE: Limit of a function

DESCRIPTION:

In mathematics a limit of a function is the value the function approaches as the input approaches some value.  Limits are essential to calculus and are used to define continuity, derivatives and integrals.  In formulas, a limit is usually written as:
$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow c} f(n) = L
$$
which is read as "in the limit as $n$ approaches $c$ the function $f(n)$ equals $L$."

Limits often appear when you have functions that are quotients:
$$
f(x) = \frac{g(x)}{h(x)}
$$
the reason being that if there can be values of $x$ for which the function in the numerator, $g(x)$, and the function in the denominator, $h(x)$, both equal either $0$ or $\infty$.  The values of $\frac{0}{0}$ and $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$ are both undefined. 

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to explain what we mean by a limit and why limits are important in mathematics.
- You should be able to explain when we need to find the value of a function by solving a limit.  In other words, you should be able to recognise the input values at which the function is undefined.
- You should be able to find the values of limits of quotients by manipulating the expression into a more pliant form using algebraic arguments.

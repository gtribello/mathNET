TITLE: Conditional probability

DESCRIPTION:

All the problems below require you to think about whether you are calculating conditional 
or absolute probabilities.  As you do them rember that the conditional probability that the 
random variable $X=1$ given that the random variable $Y=9$ is calculated using:
$$
P(X=1|Y=9) = \frac{P(X=1 \wedge Y=9)}{P(Y=9)}
$$

EXAMPLE_PROBLEM:

You get through to the final round of a television game show. The host offers you
three boxes one of which contains a fabulous prize. You are asked to select a box.
The host then opens one of the two boxes that you did not select and offers you the
opportunity to stick with your original choice or to change. What is the best thing
to do?

WORKED_SOLUTION:

This is an example of the famous Monty Hall problem. The answer in short is that it is always
better to change as this increases the likelihood that you will win the prize. Many people find this
counter intuitive when they first encounter this result so it is worth taking some time to think
about why this is the result.

Lets begin by thinking of all the way the game can play out.  We begin by introducing a Bernoulli 
random variable, $X$, that equals one if you select the door with the prize and zero otherwise. 
Now obviously we know that:

$$
P(X=1)=\frac{1}{3} \qquad \qquad \textrm{and} \qquad \qquad P(X=0)=\frac{2}{3}
$$

Lets now introduce a second random variable, $Y$, that describes which door the host opens.  This is 
the critical part of the problem.  <b> The random variable $Y$ is not independent of the random variable
$X$ </b>.  This is intuitively obvious - the host will not open the door that has the prize behind it and 
he/she will not open the door that you picked - consequently the value of $X$ affects the value of $Y$ so 
these variables are not independent.  The reason people go wrong is connected to the fact that it is difficult
to work out what implication this intuitively obvious realization has on the mathematics.

To make the nomenclature simpler in what follows we note that $Y$ - the random variable that describes 
the door the host opens - can only take one of two values, $0$ or $1$.  This is the case because the host 
cannot open the door the contestant selected - there are thus only two doors remaining for him/her to choose from.  Now, 
given that $X$ and $Y$ are not independent we must work out values for the conditional probabilities:
$P(Y=1|X=0)$, $P(Y=0|X=0)$, $P(Y=1|X=1)$ and $P(Y=0|X=1)$.  These <b> conditional </b> probabilities are:
$$
P(Y=1|X=0)=1 \qquad P(Y=0|X=0)=0 \qquad P(Y=1|X=1)=\frac{1}{2} \qquad P(Y=0|X=1)=\frac{1}{2}
$$  
The values of $P(Y=1|X=1)$ and $P(Y=0|X=1)$ are as we expect.  There are two doors and the host is free 
to open either of them so the classical interpretation of probability tells us that the probability here is
$\frac{1}{2}$.  The host is only free to open either door, however, because $X=1$.  That is to say the host is only 
free to open either door because prize is behind the door the contestant selected initially.  When this is not the case (i.e. when $X=0$) the host 
is forced to open one particular door as doing otherwise would reveal the prize.  This is why we have 
$P(Y=1|X=0)=1$ and $(Y=0|X=0)=0$.  We are now in a position to work out absolute probabilities for all the various 
(mutually exclusive) ways the game could play out using the definition of conditional probabilty.  This gives us the following:
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(Y=0 \wedge X=0 ) & = P(Y=0|X=0)P(X=0) = 0 \times \frac{2}{3} = 0 \\
P(Y=1 \wedge X=0 ) & = P(Y=1|X=0)P(X=0) = 1 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \\
P(Y=0 \wedge X=1 ) & = P(Y=0|X=1)P(X=1) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{6} \\
P(Y=1 \wedge X=1 ) & = P(Y=1|X=1)P(X=1) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{6} 
\end{aligned}
$$

EXAMPLE_PROBLEM:

You are on a game show in which there is a prize behind one of $n$ 
doors.  At the start of this game you select one door.  The host then opens 
$k<n-1$ of the remaining doors and shows you that there is no prize behind any 
of them.  You are then offered the chance to stick with your original choice of 
door or to change.  Determine the probability that you will win the game if you 
stick with your original choice of door and determine the probability that you 
win the game when you change to one of the unopened doors.

WORKED_SOLUTION:

$$
P = \frac{n-1}{n(n-1-k)}
$$

EXERCISE: Exercise 1

If two cards are drawn from a deck of cards calculate the probability
that (a) they are both spades and (b) they both belong to the same suit.  (a
deck of cards consists of 52 cards each one of which belongs to one of four
suits. The number of cards in each of these suits is equal to 13)

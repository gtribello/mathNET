    <EXAMPLE>
      <QUESTION>
An urn contains 3 balls a red one, a green one and a blue one. Consider an
experiment in which balls are drawn at random and then replaced. Define the sample space for
such an experiment if this is done twice. What is the probability for each element in the sample
space? 
</QUESTION>
      <SOLUTION>
The sample space is:
<br/><br/> 
<table>
<col width="100"/>
<col width="100"/>
<col width="100"/>
<tr><td> red red </td><td> red green </td><td> red blue </td></tr>
<tr><td> green red </td><td> green green </td><td> green blue </td></tr>
<tr><td> blue red </td><td> blue green </td><td> blue blue </td></tr>
</table>

The classical interpretation of probability means all combinations are equally likely.  Hence:
$$
P = \frac{1}{9} \nonumber
$$

Consider the problem described in the example but now suppose that the balls are not replaced.  Enumerate the 
possible outcomes and calculate the probabilities.

What is the probabilities that two randomly selected people have their birthday on the 4th October (assume no leap years)?

      <SOLUTION>
$$
P = \left( \frac{1}{365} \right)^2

      <QUESTION>
In the game of bridge 4 players share out the 52 cards in a deck.  In each round three players play while the last player (the dummy)
lays his cards out on the table for this partner (the declarer) to play.  If the declarer can see that he and the dummy have 8 of the heart
cards between them he knows that the two hands that he cannot see must hold five heart cards between them.  What are the probabilities that
the cards are split 0:5, 1:4 and 2:3 between the other two players?
</QUESTION>
      <SOLUTION>
<ul>
<li>Probability of 0:5 split : 0.06 </li>
<li>Probability of 1:4 split : 0.32 </li>
<li>Probability of 2:3 split : 0.62 </li>
</ul>

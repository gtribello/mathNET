    "# Gamblers ruin\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we are going to look at an famous Markov chain problem known as Gamblers ruin.  Questions on this particular Markov chain appear on exam papers about Stochastic Processes that are set at many universities.  These questions will often have a structure something like the one below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a gambler enters a casino with 4 pounds to his name.  The game he choses to play involves beting one pound and he can either win or loose.  If he wins he wins back double his stake so if he enters with 4 pounds and wins the first game he then has 5 pounds.  If by contrast he looses the game he looses his stake so if he enters with 4 pounds and looses the first game he now has only 3 pounds.  The gambler decides to stop playing if:\n",
    "\n",
    "- He runs out of money.  In other words he stops playing once he has 0 pounds.\n",
    "- Or if he has 10 pounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the probability of winning each individual game is equal to 0.45 and if the outcomes of all the games are independent calculate the probability that the gambler looses all his money and the expected number of games he would play.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we are going to write a program to simulate this gambler.  Before we get on to that first of all you need to take some time to understand the problem.  Hence, in your notes on this exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain why the amount of money the gambler has can be modelled using a Markov chain.\n",
    "- Explain how many states there are in this Markov chain.\n",
    "- Draw the transition graph for this Markov chain.\n",
    "- Identify which states are transient and whcih states are recurrent in this Markov chain.\n",
    "- Write out the transition matrix for this Markov chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed these tasks then move on to the remainder of the exercises contained herein.  As always these tasks begin with some code for dynamic plotting that I have written for you so please press shift and enter on the cell below to begin."

    "# Generating gambling instances\n",

    "I think that it is useful to think about this problem in terms of a hierarchy of randomness.  The outcome of each individual game is random and as such the eventual outcome - either the gambler leaving with 10 pounds to his name or leaving with nothing - is random.  In addition, the number of games he will play before leaving the casino is also random.  When we look at things this way we realise that this complicated random object is ultimately constructed from two relatively-simple mathematical objects that we understand.  We just using a Bernoulli random variable and the number line (counting).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of thinking about this problem is as a random walk with discrete steps along the number line.  To be clear there are 11 states in the chain (having 0, 1, 2, $\\dots$, or 10 pounds).  Obviously, the order in which the gambler will visit these states is random.  Furthermore, if there are  two gamblers they will not visit these states in the same order.  To illustrate some possible outcomes I have written the following code.  If you press shift and enter on the cell below the set of states visited by 9 independent gamblers will be shown in a new window.  "

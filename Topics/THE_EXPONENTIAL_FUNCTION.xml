  <DESCRIPTION>


There are many real life examples of problems where the rate of change of a function at time $t$ is proportional to the 

value of that same functions.  In other words we find the following differential equation in many different contexts:

$$

\frac{\textrm{d}f(x)}{\textrm{d}x} = f(x)

$$

(although often times the $f(x)$ on the right hand side is multiplied by some constant).  If you want examples

of when this comes up think about interest rates, the decay of radioactive isotopes, population growth,...



The solution of this differential equation is:

$$

f(x) = Ae^{x}

$$

In this expression $e^x$ is given by:

$$

 e^x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!}

$$

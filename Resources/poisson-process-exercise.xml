     In this exercise we are going to learn how to model poisson, exponential and compound poisson processes.  This should prepare you for the exercises on modelling queues
     and other continuous time Markov chains.

    <DESCRIPTION>
      This first exercise should largely be revision.  We are going to look at one way of generating a Poisson process.  The way this method works is that 
      we model fixed increments in time, $t$.  The random number that tells us how many Poisson events occur in a fixed increment of time, $t$, is given by 
      a Poisson random variable with parameter $\lambda t$.  Given this information use the blocks below to generate a Poisson process with $\lambda=1$ by 
      simulating a set of discrete time intervals of with length $t=1$.  Simulate at least 20 of these intervals and use the blocks to plot the total number 
      of events that have occured as a function of time.

    <DESCRIPTION>
      The previous exercise did not tell us exactly when each of the events occured.  We can gather this information, however, by recalling that if 1 event occurs 
      in a time window of length $t$ the conditional probability density for the time of occurance has a uniform probability density over the time interval
      in question.  With this information in mind adjust the blocks and generate the times at which each of the events occurs.  Then adjust the blocks that you wrote in 
      the previous exercise so that the graph only shows an increase in the number of events at exactly the times at which the random events occur.

      Let's now change tack slightly.  See if you can use the blocks below to generate an exponentially distributed random variable with parameter $\lambda=1$.  Generate
      50 such random variables, $X_i$, and draw a graph showing in which each of your random variables is plotted at $(i,X_i)$.  Each of the $i$s here should just be one of 
      the set of integers between 1 and 50.

    <DESCRIPTION>
      It is possible to show that the distribution of the times between the adjacent arrivals for a Poisson process with parameter $\lambda$ is given by an 
      exponentially distributed random variable with parameter $\lambda$.  Use this information and the blocks below to write a program that can simulate a 
      poisson process.  Use the plotting tools to show the number of events that occur as a function of time.  Your program should work in a manner that is 
      different from the program that you wrote in earlier exercises to simulate the Poisson process.

       The ammount of money spent in a particular 24-hour shop can be modelled using a Compound Poisson process with parameters $\lambda=5$, $\mu=10$ and $\sigma^2=15$.
       Use the blocks below to draw a graph that shows the result from a simulation that models how the ammount of money spent in this shop changes as a function of time.

  <REVIEW>
     The exercise you have just performed has taught you the basics of simulating continuous time Markov chains.  You will need to use everything that you have learnt by performing 
     these exercises when you perform the final two pieces of coursework for this module.

    <LI> At the (unconstrained) optimum of a function the partial derivatives are equal to</LI>
    <LI> At the (unconstrainted) optimum the grad of the function is equal to</LI>
    <LI> Is the grad of a function, $\nabla f(x,y)$, a scalar or a vector quantity</LI>
    <LI> Complete the following sentence: At a constrained optimum the grad of the function and the grad of the constraint...</LI>
    <LI> Explain (in your own words) the purpose of Lagrange's method of undetermined multipliers</LI>
    <LI> State the two steps in Lagrange's method of undetermined multipliers</LI>
    <LI> Write an expression for the extended function that must be optimised in order to optimise the function $f(x,y)$ subject to the constraint $g(x,y)=c$</LI>

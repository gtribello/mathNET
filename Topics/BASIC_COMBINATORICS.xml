  <DESCRIPTION>


If we have $n$ distinguishable objects (i.e. $n$ things that we can tell apart) 

then there are $n!$ different ways we can order these objects.  



If we have $n$ objects and only 

$r$ of them are distinguishable - in other words if our $n$ objects contain 

$(n-r)$ copies of the same item - then there are $\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$ ways of 

ordering these objects.  

To be clear these  $\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$ arrangements of the objects are the ones 

we can tell apart.  Obviously, if we swap the indistinguishable items we get the 

same pattern and thus it is not possible to distinguish between the two arrangements.  



If we have $n$ objects: $r$ objects of one type and $(n-r)$ objects of a second different 

type, then there are $\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$ distinct ways of ordering our objects.

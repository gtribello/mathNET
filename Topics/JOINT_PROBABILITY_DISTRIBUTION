TITLE: Joint probability distribution

DESCRIPTION:

If you have a pair of random variables $X$ and $Y$ the joint probability distribution function, $F_{XY}(x,y)$ tells you the following probability.
$$
F_{XY}(x,y) = P( X \le x \wedge Y \le y )
$$
This function does not appear that often and it is more common to work with the joint probability mass function if the random variables are discrete:
$$
f_{XY}(x,y) = P( X=x \wedge Y=y )
$$
You can calculate the marginal distribution, $f_X(x)$, for the random variable $X$ from the joint probability mass function using:
$$
f_X(x) = P( X=x ) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty f_{XY}(x,y_i)
$$
Similarly the marginal distribution, $f_Y(y)$, for the random variable $Y$ can be found using:
$$
f_Y(y) = P( Y=y ) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty f_{XY}(x_i,y)
$$

LEARNINGOUTCOMES:

- You should be able to explain the meanings of the joint probability mass function and joint probability distribution functions for a pair of random variables.
- You should be able to derive the marginal probability mass function for a discrete random variable from the joint probability mass function.

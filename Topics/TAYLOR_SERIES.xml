  <DESCRIPTION>


A Taylor series is a series expansion of a function about a point.  The Taylor series of a real function $f(x)$ around a point $x=a$ is given by:

$$

f(x) = f(a) + (x-a)f'(a) + \frac{(x-a)^2}{2!} f''(a) + \frac{(x-a)^3}{3!} f'''(a) + \dots + \frac{(x-a)^n}{n!} f^{(n)}(a) + \dots

$$

An alternate way of writing this in summation notion is as follows:

$$

f(x + \delta x ) = f(x) + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(\delta x)^n}{n!} \frac{d^{(n)}f(x)}{\textrm{d}x}

$$

The McLaurin expansion of a function is the Taylor series expansion around $a=0$
